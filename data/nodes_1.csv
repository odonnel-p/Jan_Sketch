Tenney, Jr. Torch Scholarship. First and foremost I would like to share my gratitude, I hope the kindness of Mr. Tenney is repaid in blessings. I am currently on my first semester of my third year on co-op in New York. I started at Northeastern the summer of 2014. I am a Torch scholar, and as you may or may not know, we are required to start taking classes the summer before our freshman year. It was a stressful summer to say the least, but I found the family I never knew I had within my class (I am a member of Torch 9). I have always known what I was going to study, which is Criminal Justice, but through the guidance of Mr. Jackson (Torch’s academic advisor) I expanded my track and am now double majoring in Political Science. My plan is to go on to law school after my undergraduate degree, so it is smart for me to fortify my reading and writing skills through these majors. I am not sure what kind of lawyer I would like to be yet, but I plan to figure that out in law school, and years down the line maybe join congress. I am only 4’11”, but I have dreams higher than the Eiffel Tower.  ","Thanks to this scholarship, I have been able to complete four semesters of schooling as mentioned, which included going abroad for a half semester to London and Paris to study fashion as an elective. I was studying for six weeks and extended my stay for another week to explore Italy on my own for a week. I was able to see Milan, Florence, Venice and Rome. I have taken incredible classes such as Criminal Due Process, Intro to Computer Science, etc., all while completing 100 hours of community service and working part-time. Actually, during my third semester I was working full-time across two jobs and still maintained my GPA above a 3.0.  ","This semester I am in New York City working as an investigative intern for the Bronx Defenders. We are out in the streets all day getting testimonies, serving subpoenas, tracking people down, and all of the other things an investigator has to do. It is a lot of work, but it is very rewarding given that the Bronx Defenders is non-profit and does not charge their clients. And coming up over spring break in March, I will be taking a week off work to travel to Nicaragua with a team at Northeastern to go volunteer at an orphanage there for an alternative spring break.  ","In conclusion, it is an honor to be given the privilege to be a Torch scholar and having loyal alumni and friends of Northeastern who support us. I hope that through reading this letter you can understand how seriously we take this support. I can pursue who I want to be because those who support me, and my family and I are eternally grateful.

I am truly grateful that you have invested in Torch, because it has literally changed my life. Sometimes I still can’t believe that I was blessed enough to receive this scholarship to go to my dream school. I am truly appreciative that you care about my success. I hope you had a nice summer and that you are doing well. I have so much to tell you! Over the summer, I went back home to Charlotte and caught up on rest after a challenging spring semester. I had time to relax and learned some new software programs to prepare for the upcoming semester of architecture classes. The software I learned was Revit, 3ds Max, and VRay. Right now, these software are helping me through this semester. This summer was really productive for me, and I even got to work on some old paintings that I haven’t touched in years. As an Architecture major, I think it’s important to keep up with all artistic skills. As for now, my classes are definitely more time-consuming than I originally imagined. I’m just getting past midterms, so I’m trying to push hard through the semester, and I have to remind myself that I will get through it no matter what. Although I am busy with school work, I somehow managed to join a couple of clubs. Currently, I am on the Student Advisory Board for the College of Arts, Media and Design as a representative of Architecture, AIAS, and Intervarsity. I’m also trying to make an effort to leave campus every once in a while. While I don’t have as much free time, I do have some goals I hope to achieve before the semester is over. I’m trying to start a new website for architecture students so they can have access to software tutorials for their portfolios. It’s a work in progress!  I’m excited for next semester because I will get to apply for a co-op for next year. A lot of my older architecture friends told me how great co-op is compared to studio. Although the long hours probably won’t change, it’s definitely great to finally put all those skills to work. For now, I’m thinking of doing research with a civil engineering professor for the spring semester. At this moment, I am really trying to stay motivated and focused, because time is moving quickly.  Hopefully you are having a great week, and I hope to hear from you soon! Thanks again for everything",,,,

I am now in my fourth year working towards a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing and a minor in communications.  I have continued to make the most of my time at Northeastern and in the great city of Boston. When I wrote my last letter to you, I was in the middle of my second co-op at EMC as an Inside Sales Rep.  Since I have completed that co-op, and through connections that I made in that position, I landed an internship with the Boston Bruins.  It has always been a dream of mine to work in the sports industry, and this has been an amazing experience.  I am working in the marketing department helping with marketing initiatives, and game night tasks.  I am also balancing my internship with a full course load.  As of now I am on a track to graduate in August.   My experience with the Bruins has proven to me that I prefer to work in sales rather than marketing.  My goal is still to graduate and become a sales representative at either EMC, or any other company in the technology industry, and I am well on my way to achieving my goal. ",,,,

I was very honored and appreciative to learn that I was selected as a recipient for this award. ,"I am from East Greenwich, Rhode Island and attended The Prout School. While in high school, I decided early on that I would love to attend Northeastern University for a variety of reasons, primarily for the Cooperative Education Program. However, because of financial circumstances, my parents were unable to assist me in the financing necessary to attend Northeastern. Faced with this reality, I made the choice to take on the financial burden of attending school on my own. In the past four years, I worked a number of part-time jobs and took out student loans to finance my living and education expenses. I am so grateful for the Conley Family Goldman Sachs Scholarship because it has allowed me to decrease the amount on the private student loan I borrowed for this year. Truly, this scholarship has lifted a significant financial burden from my shoulders. Currently, I am a senior in the D’Amore-McKim School of Business and I am pursuing a double concentration of Finance and Management. Additionally, I am an Honors student and a participant in the New World Scholars program. The New World Scholars program is organized by Professor Allan Bird and features discussion with leading researchers and professors about major topics in business today. Because of this program, I had the unique opportunity to travel to China and Japan last year to visit with local corporations and learn about how global business is conducted. I have completed three co-ops while attending Northeastern University. The first was at the nonprofit Education First Foundation for Foreign Study, where I worked on the Compliance Team. The second was at Gelfand, Rennert, and Feldman, LLP, a music royalty and accounting firm. Finally, my third co-op was completed at Arrowstreet Capital, LP. All three co-ops provided me with real experience that guided my coursework in the D’Amore-McKim School of Business. The combination of this work experience and the unique course offering of the business school has inspired me to pursue a career in management consulting. This past semester, I accepted an offer from Hitachi Consulting for a consultant position beginning after I graduate in May. Through the generous support of the Conley Family Goldman Sachs Scholarship Fund, I have been able to lessen the burden of student loan debt and focus more on my studies in my final year at Northeastern University. Words cannot express how grateful I am to the donors that have made this possible. I hope that one day, I will be able to assist students attend their top choice college, just as this scholarship has helped me.  ",,,

I am a 3rd year student at Northeastern University majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Supply Chain Management. This year I was very fortunate and blessed to receive the Conley Family Scholarship. As a first generation college student, this scholarship means less financial pressures off of my family and also allows me to reduce my loan package. Since I moved from St. Thomas (Virgin Islands) to Rhode Island when I was nine years old, I always took my education seriously. My motivation and drive was cultivated by my desire to make my parents proud and also for a better future.As a college student I recognize the opportunities available to me and I am taking advantage of them to the fullest. One of my biggest passions is giving back and helping others. My first year at Northeastern I joined InterVarsity which is a Multi-ethnic Christian Fellowship. With InterVarsity I have been able to travel to New Orleans during spring break and work closely with Habitat for Humanity to build and paint houses in the communities still affected by Katrina. I have also been able to travel to the Dominican Republic and Haiti and serve organizations such as Food for the Hungry, which help provide programs and meals to the poorest communities in the Dominican Republic; and Haiti Partners which helps provide education for the children in Haiti. These experiences have been key components of my educational and spiritual growth. I was also awarded the Kwanzaa Community and Civic Engagement award during my freshman year.I am currently working in my first Co-Op rotation at Johnson & Johnson in Cumberland, Rhode Island. I am a CPFR Co-Op which means: Collaborative, Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment. My main responsibilities include managing the Neutrogena Cosmetics business, ordering products that will be delivered to over 7,600 CVS stores and updating weekly and monthly reports. This Co-Op experience is giving me valuable exposure into the delivery process of Supply Chain and Logistics. I am very fortunate to work at such a well-known and growing company as J&J. So far, I have learned many skills that I will take with me wherever I go and especially into my professional career. As this six-month Co-Op opportunity comes to a close, I plan to go back to campus for Spring semester and continue taking courses in my major and possibly pick up a double concentration or minor. I am interested in learning more about marketing, finance and entrepreneurship. After spring semester I am planning on participating in a Dialogue of Civilizations (one-month study abroad) to Sicily, Italy to learn about entrepreneurship and family businesses.I am really grateful for you and your scholarship fund as it enables me to continue pursuing higher education. My family has always struggled financially, but I know that soon that will all change. Thank you for investing in my education and making my dream of graduating college one step closer. ",,,,

My name is Henry Mota, and I am a fourth year junior at Northeastern University. I am a candidate for a bachelor’s degree in the D’Amore-McKim School of Business, concentrating in supply chain and entrepreneurship.  Northeastern has truly been a blessing in my life. The school has given me many opportunities and has opened doors for my future that otherwise I would not have access to.  I chose Northeastern University first and foremost because it was my first choice from the schools I was applying to, but also thanks to the Ujima Global Leaders Program. Ujima is a program for students who have an understanding of different cultures and ethnicities. Many times the program gives an opportunity to students who may not have the financial resources to attend Northeastern or sometimes gives a hand to students who might not quite meet all the requirements needed to attend this prestigious university.  Co-op played a huge role in my becoming a Husky as well. I have taken full advantage of the co-op program; I am now completing my second co-op as a supply chain analyst with Medtronics, previously Covidien, located in Mansfield, MA. I did my first co-op as a technical support analyst in the Harvard Law School Information Technologies center. The support that I provided to students was greatly appreciated.  I cannot thank you enough for your help, it really goes a long way. Your support makes a unique impact on each and every student. For me, your support is truly the difference between having to work two jobs during the semester to pay off loans or being able to shift my focus and energy to my education. Being brought up the way I was I understand how hard work and dedication is key to success I am aware of the value of a dollar, and it really makes an impact to have your financial support down the home stretch of my academic years at Northeastern. You are truly a role model and one day I look to be able to support students and be of help to others the same way you have been in my life. I hope sometime we can meet and I am able to put a name to face to the Conley Family, whose scholarship has truly made a difference in my life.   ",,,,

This is my first year at Northeastern and I am very happy with my decision to attend. I am majoring in Business Administration and have not yet declared a concentration, but I am considering combine majoring in Finance and Economics. This semester I took Statistics, Macroeconomics, Experiential Entrepreneurship, and Financial Accounting. My favorite class was Experiential Entrepreneurship. In this class, we completed a semester long project that involved coming up with a business concept to improve TJX. Our group decided to increase TXJ’s target market through the male population in order to increase their overall revenue. We created a demographic redesign firm that would redesign the store layout of the male departments of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, advertising to the male target market, and hiring trend analysts to keep merchandise current. Throughout the semester, we developed and refined our business concept, presentation, and business plan that we presented at the end of the semester. I am also involved in Women in Business and hope to join more student organizations in the spring. Over the next four to five years, I am looking forward to continuing my education in business both at Northeastern and abroad, gaining experience through co-op, and being involved in extracurricular activities and community service. Thank you again for your support of Northeastern education and the Conley Family Scholarship. I really appreciate your generous contribution to my education.",,,,

State Street Global Advisors has even offered me a part time position during the school semester and wants to hire me full time as soon as I graduate.  I was just some kid that was going to Community College of Rhode Island and had no clue what awaited my future. I now have a clear vision of what I want and having the financial peace of mind is an enormous blessing.

Thank you for giving me an opportunity to succeed here at Northeastern.  ,"Growing up in Rhode Island, the prospect of going to school in Boston was very exciting. It is a unique place that offers career opportunities for students that is close to home. After doing my own research on schools, Northeastern was one that stood out for me. With its experiential learning and campus environment, it really seemed like a place I could fit in. I applied for admission, but was rejected, and decided to attend Suffolk University.  Once I arrived in Boston for my freshmen year, I realized even more how much I wanted to be at Northeastern. I worked as hard as I could to make this dream a reality. I joined clubs, participated in community service projects, and maintained a 3.8 G.P.A. I thought I did enough to get into Northeastern but was rejected once again. After thinking about it, I called admissions to find out why. They realized they made a mistake and had coded me incorrectly in their system. They reversed that decision that day, making my dream a reality.  Since attending Northeastern I have tried to make the most of this opportunity.  I am in two clubs, Beta Alpha Psi and Finance and Investment Club. For Beta Alpha Psi I hold an officer position as VP of Marketing. I wanted to take a leadership role to really take ownership in something at this university. Additionally, I have made dean’s list every semester by maintaining a GPA of 3.53. I have pushed myself as much as I could here to ensure that I made the most out of the experience. Outside the classroom, I have competed three successful co-ops, at Covidien, Putnam Investments, and Wellington Management. At these companies, I always did my best to be a positive representative of Northeastern University.   Even with trying to save a majority of my checks on co-op, affording tuition has been difficult.  This is why I am so grateful for the Conley Family Scholarship, which has helped me continue to afford my dream for two years. I cannot truly express how much this award has meant.

This award from the Conley Family Scholarship will have an immense impact on my future. Private education in the United States is expensive, and this scholarship will bestow upon me some much appreciated and much needed support. I’ve saved money from the two co-ops I’ve worked for, but every bit that will help me be more financially stable while beginning post-graduate life is a remarkable gift. Post-graduate life is just around the corner for me. The current fall semester is winding down, and afterwards I’ll have just one more semester to complete. For the past three years I’ve been enrolled in the D’Amore-McKim School of Business, pursuing a Bachelor’s with a concentration in Marketing. I spent the first two years of my college education as an Undeclared student. For a time in high school I thought I would go to school for film, but I wavered during college applications. I ultimately chose Northeastern because I was unsure of what I wanted to do and I was attracted to the co-op program. I eventually chose to study Business was because I was still unsure about what I wanted to do and felt Business would offer me a degree with which I could do a multitude of different things. I’ve not lost my artistic dreams, however; in my free time I enjoy writing – both fiction and non-fiction – and graphic design.  Truthfully, I’m unsure whether I wish to pursue anything related to business or marketing after I’ve graduated – at least not immediately. Although I’ve been blessed with the opportunity to have worked for two fantastic co-ops, my experience at each has led me away from business. During my first co-op I worked for a Cambridge-based biotech company called the ALS Therapy Development Institute. As you can infer from the name, they specialize in researching and developing treatments for ALS. During my second co-op earlier this year, I worked for a local marketing firm called Fiksu that specializes in mobile and online marketing. I had a variety of duties at both jobs, but I most enjoyed the opportunities I had to develop my skills as a designer. Co-op is also an incredible tool for personal growth and development. The financial support your scholarship lends will be significant in easing my transition into post-graduate life. Although my plans are unclear, economic freedom provides me the opportunity to explore what interests me and discover the career path that most suits me. For this, I am tremendously thankful.

The Conley Family Scholarship has again been presented to me in your name as I enter my final semester at Northeastern. Your kindness has lessened the burden of student loans that challenge the financial stability of many post-graduates.   Since the spring semester, I have enhanced my professional skills in various areas. After travelling through Europe, returning to EMC World for the 2014 event, and completing a semester of coursework, I began my final co-op with Fidelity Investments in July. I sought experience related to corporate events from a new, content focused, perspective. The Fidelity position focuses on seminars and lectures, a series of internal and external speakers who present forward-thinking ideas at the company headquarters in Boston. In addition to these lectures and seminars, my team organizes TEDxBoston, which was held at the Great Hall in Faneuil Hall this year. I owe Northeastern my utmost gratitude for the education and work experiences I have had since January 2011. I owe them many thanks for the Empower program that has been established. Your generosity has enhanced my college experience, and I owe you many thanks for that. Your donation has allowed me to spend less time searching couch cushions for spare change, and more time enhancing my professional skills, building a strong resume, and being involved on campus. In the spring, I will take over as Director of Events for a student-run design company, called Scout. This is an area of business I have a new interest in due to my experience working with the Design Thinking team within Fidelity Labs. Without this scholarship in your name, I would use my extra time this spring on work-study or working a local part-time job. Instead, I can accept a leadership position in an up-and-coming student company at Northeastern.May is creeping closer every day. I am excited to graduate, but it will be bittersweet leaving Northeastern. I am currently researching opportunities in various corporate event areas. My dream is to work for Hasbro and continue living in Rhode Island. This would be especially exciting if the acquisition of Dreamworks Animation occurs. Outside of Hasbro, I am looking into opportunities in the Boston area, continuing at Fidelity or EMC Corporation, or moving to the west coast if an opportunity with Disney arises. My dreams are in production of becoming reality. Thanks to your kindness, graduation will surely commence my happily ever after.",,,,

Your kindness awards students like me the opportunity to study at this great institution in order to advance towards brighter horizons from modest beginnings back in Rhode Island. ","As you may recall from past letters, I am a native of West Warwick and attended schools in the West Warwick Public School system throughout my childhood. When my brother, three years my elder, began looking into colleges we visited Greater Boston schools, Philadelphia schools and a few others in between. Admittedly, I do not remember much about our Northeastern visit apart from the fact that my dad made a Red Sox joke on one of the elevators while wearing a Yankees hat, prompting another father to jokingly say “you do know where you are, right?”   During my senior year of high school, less than a year after my brother began attending Bentley University, our dad was diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer that impacts approximately 100 people globally. In March 2012 he lost his fight, a three-year battle that was not supposed to last longer than six months. Needless to say, this entire situation took a great toll on our family finances. Luckily, the world is full of great people like yourself who find it in your hearts to give back to those less fortunate.   While I am not exactly diving into swimming pools of gold coins, I do try to help out my friends and others when possible. Having served as Chancellor of the Nu Epsilon Zeta Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi for the past year and a half I can assuredly say that I must have received at least three emails a week regarding various fundraisers, community service opportunities, philanthropic events, and everything else under the sun. I will be the first to admit that I am sadly not a superhero, but I have always tried to motivate those around me into doing what they can in order to help out a worthy cause.   With two semesters remaining in my collegiate career I am very happy to say that I will be studying abroad this spring in Barcelona. Ever since my brother studied in Manchester I have wanted to have the same opportunity to see Europe, an experience aided by greater financial security through your scholarship. I am even more excited to say that I will be wrapping up my finance concentration while abroad while also studying the rich history and culture of the Mediterranean.   I look forward to the great unknown that follows graduation, and I will once again insist on you allowing me the opportunity to at least buy you a cup of coffee in order to get a chance to better know the man who has been allowing me to study at Northeastern over the past few years.  You are truly an upstanding individual and the Northeastern community is lucky to have benefactors like yourself to better the lives of our students.

As a current recipient, and on behalf of any future recipient, thank you so much for your continued support to Northeastern, but most of all, thank you for supporting us, the students.  ","It is a great pleasure, and honor, to be a recipient of the Conley Family Scholarship. Thank you very much! I am a senior at Northeastern University studying economics and finance and I will be graduating this spring in 2016. I was born and raised in Rhode Island, living in Warwick when I was younger and moving to Richmond in my middle and high school years. I graduated from Chariho Regional High School in 2012 and have been enjoying my time at NU ever since.   I come from a very family-centric background, and have always had a very close relationship with my immediate and secondary family. My parents were divorced when I was very young and both went on remarry and have children. As a result, I have many brothers and sister (8 total: which includes my step- and half-siblings) all of whom I am close to. With so many siblings, it is infeasible to expect financial support from my parents, although I know they would love nothing more then to be able to. As a student making his way through college on student loans, this scholarship means a tremendous amount to me, as well as to my family.    As a student at Northeastern, I’ve come a long way in only a few short years, and it’s been nothing short of an adventure. I started off my university studies as a member of the NUin program, which is a first semester study abroad program. The summer after I graduated high school I packed up my things and flew out to Melbourne, Australia for four months of experiential learning. It was my first time abroad and it truly did change my philosophy on life. That experience was so powerful, and unique, that I know it will stay with me for the rest of my life. And that was only the beginning. In the many years since, I’ve had the pleasure of exploring Boston, learning as much as I can in my course work, and having a great time all the while. My passion for economics and finance hasn’t dwindled, and the difficult courses like econometrics and financial risk management have only increased my academic curiosity.   One of the primary reasons for attending Northeastern was, of course, for the co-op program. On my 6-month co-op, I worked at John Hancock Insurance in the project management office. My introduction to the professional world was an amazing experience, filled with numerous mentors and respectful co-workers. Without knowing what to expect, I had assumed I would be doing menial tasks, like getting coffee, scanning papers, or running errands, but I could not have been more wrong. Instead, I was responsible for quality work that included data management, data reporting, deck creation, and project reporting. The respect and trust I was shown in the workplace was inspiring and made me all the more eager to learn and improve.   The experiences I’ve had at Northeastern have been beyond any of my wildest expectation so far. The knowledge I’ve acquired and the relationships I’ve made will last a lifetime. The Conley Family Scholarship is now a part of my story, and has made a big impact on lessening my financial burden, and improving my future financial success. As a current recipient, and on behalf of any future recipient, thank you so much for your continued support to Northeastern, but most of all, thank you for supporting us, the students.  ",,,,

I am a second year International Affairs Major at Northeastern University, and I am privileged to have received funding for International Co-op through the Edward G. Galante Presidential Scholarship Fund. Your generosity means very much to me, as it will enable me to participate in International Co-op, a program which is a paramount part of my degree here at Northeastern.   I am from Raleigh, North Carolina and spent most of my childhood growing up in the South. I decided to come to Northeastern because I knew there was a great International Affairs Program, and I suspected Boston would be an incredible place to live (as it has been)! I hope to become a diplomat after graduating, and know that forging a career in such a competitive field will be much more easily achieved after gaining professional experiences abroad on co-op.   Recently, my dad unfortunately lost his job. Making ends meet financially has been very difficult for my family of late, and as a full time student I often feel like a heavy burden on my parents who are still my financial overseers. However, with funding from the scholarship which you have so graciously donated, I will now be able to participate in international co-op and feel certain that I am not causing a financial burden on my parents, who have already given me so much. I interview tomorrow with the Migrant Center in Belfast, Northern Ireland where I hope to be chosen for a position involved with social work with immigrants. This is an unbelievable opportunity for me, and I cannot thank your family enough for making it financially feasible!  ",,,,

","I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the generous and kind donations you give to our university. Thanks to your generosity, I have now been afforded another opportunity to work abroad through the Edward G. Galante Presidential Scholarship Fund.    I am a third year student here at Northeastern, studying both Human Services and International Affairs with a minor in Spanish. I am originally from Tucson, Arizona- this made for quite a big change for me my freshman year! I was drawn to Northeastern because of the co-op program and the opportunities it offers to co-op outside the United States. I say that I am obsessed with travel, and never like to stay in the same place for too long. I love getting to know new cultures, new languages, and new ways of doing things through living abroad.   My love for travel began when I was sixteen years old, when I was able to spend two months developing a small grant project in Paraguay with Amigos de las Américas, a high-school volunteer organization. I continued with AMIGOS, and served as field staff in Costa Rica in both 2014 and 2015. It was Northeastern that allowed me to take entire four-month summer blocks to do work that I was truly passionate about. My first official co-op at Northeastern was in Cape Town, South Africa, working at a youth development nonprofit organization. It was with your generosity that I was able to spend that time in South Africa, living and learning through intercultural exchange.  My upcoming spring co-op is with the U.S. Department of State, with the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs in Lima, Peru. I am working for the State Department through their student internship program, which allows me to both work at the Embassy as well as pursue my own independent field research. This co-op is incredibly exciting for me, as I will be working in the government sector for the first time. Hopefully, I will be able to discern whether or not a career in the foreign service is something I would like to continue pursuing after completing this internship in Lima.   Again, I would like to thank you for everything you give to Northeastern, and for your belief in the university’s global co-ops.   ",,,,

","I am genuinely and wholeheartedly grateful to be selected as a recipient of a scholarship from the Edward G. Galante Presidential Scholarship Fund. This opportunity has not only opened doors for me to build myself professionally, but also will contribute to my personal development throughout the rest of my life. My name is Cameret Bannister, and I am from Melrose, Massachusetts – a suburban city roughly ten miles north of the Greater Boston area. I am completing my fourth year at Northeastern University – a school to which I always strived to gain admittance based on its academic and professional integrity. Northeastern’s rigorous academic programs alongside of the integration of experiential learning and co-op placements make it a unique, yet authentically valuable university at the forefront of innovation and achievement. As an individual who focuses primarily on the importance of education, I have obtained placement on the Dean’s list every semester since beginning college in the fall of 2011. This ultimately lead to the successful completion of my first co-op at the Boston Globe – an organization that I not only followed closely growing up, but also gained the opportunity to see the values and integrity of the enterprise firsthand. Specifically, I chose to study international business, while concentrating my interests on marketing and obtaining an international affairs minor. I chose these pursuits because I think they are a unique alignment of business studies while maintaining the focus on being a globally conscious individual – something that is increasingly important during this contemporary day and age. With my studies came the opportunity and requirement to complete an expatriate year in Dublin, Ireland. I have completed my academic studies at Dublin City University this past fall and am commencing a co-op placement at Johnson & Johnson in Dublin; here I will be conducting marketing research for the finance team in the consumer goods department. I have specifically chosen this professional trajectory focus due to the influence of two Northeastern professors: Professor Felicia Lassk of Marketing Research and Professor Jennifer Yule of Consumer Behavior. Both women inspired me to question general marketing practices in order to unveil the “why?” behind many aspects of business. I find this critical thinking to be not only challenging, but rewarding as well. With the opportunity presented by your scholarship support, I will be able to successfully complete my international work placement and gain valuable knowledge and insights that directly align with my academic studies. I am so honored and grateful to receive such a generous offering. I extend my most gracious and thankful appreciation to you; you have enabled my professional, academic, and personal development beyond belief.  ",,,,

I loved both schools and knew that both offered very good educations with rigorous programs that would force me to strive to excel within my major. Thus, I was struggling to make the final decision. Eventually I decided to revert back to paper and put down the benefits of each school. It quickly became clear that Northeastern – with the opportunity to have multiple co-ops as well as spend a significant amount of time abroad – was the best choice. Getting a short opportunity to study abroad my first semester in Costa Rica and having done a domestic co-op were both terrific opportunities that left me very excited for my next and current co-op experience here in Spain.  Being an International Business student with a minor in Spanish, I was thrilled when I got accepted for a co-op at a firm here in Madrid, Spain, that deals with distressed assets and portfolio analysis. However, I quickly came to the realization that financials would be a major issue. International co-ops pay significantly less than those back home in the states, and despite the fact that I had saved most of what I had received from my last co-op, I knew I would still be financially strained if I took the position. Your generous scholarship made my international co-op experience possible. Having started a month and a half ago, I can say that not only have I learned a significant amount about asset analysis and European business methods, but my Spanish-speaking skills have also improved drastically. I cannot thank you enough for making this opportunity possible. ",,"Though this co-op experience has made me aware of a whole new range of potential career options, it has made me a little nervous, if I am being completely honest. These will be my last six months at Northeastern, and I need to start looking for jobs. However, I am excited as well as extremely grateful to you for helping me to complete my undergraduate experience at Northeastern on a high-note.   ",,

My name is Milenis Cevallo-Pimentel, and I have been awarded the Jean Tempel Torch Scholarship. I am originally from Charlestown, MA, and my family is from the Dominican Republic. I am currently in my third year studying nursing. This has been a dream come true in all aspects. I am the first in my family to graduate high school, so being in college was a huge success story. I knew Northeastern would be a great school for nursing because of the endless opportunities in Boston and the co-op possibilities! However, I never thought I would get into my top school of choice, have the Torch Scholarship, and be a nursing major at the same time!  ","It was a challenge to grow up in a town surrounded by negativity and receive my education from public schools, but in the end, it was worth it all. I had great mentors and support figures that pushed me along the way and even nominated me for this wonderful scholarship. There are not enough words in this world to tell you how appreciative and thankful I am to have this support. It truly keeps me going when I am having hard times because I know there is someone out there who believes in me and wants me to continue pushing forward.   ","I am currently applying for my first co-op position. This will be a great opportunity to master my nursing skills and apply everything I have learned in class to the real world. I am a visual learner, and I know I will benefit a lot from this experience. My goal after graduation is to become a registered nurse specializing in trauma care. I like to work in fast-paced environments where I need to think quickly and make smart decisions. A place like the Emergency Department would be great! It makes me very excited to even think about my future. It is completely possible because of you! I am so immensely appreciative of your financial support and want you to know that it has been very important to me.   Thank you so much for your ongoing support.  I wish you the very best!   ",,

It truly means so much to my family and me.,"I would first like to start off by thanking you for your contribution to the Torch Program! It truly means so much to my family and me. My name is Joely, and I am an undeclared freshman at Northeastern. The reason I am here at Northeastern is solely due to the existence of the Torch Program. It all started when one of my guidance counselors suggested I apply, and that day truly changed my life. I now like to endearingly say that Northeastern chose me and, in turn, I fell in love with Northeastern through the Torch Program. As a working-class first generation college student, the only way I am able to afford an education here—the only way my attendance here is possible—is through the Torch scholarship.   I was born in Caracas, Venezuela, but immigrated here with my mother when I was five. We were seeking refuge from a city that was becoming increasingly volatile (Caracas is known for being the seventh most violent city in the world). After being robbed at gunpoint, my mother and I left my father and family members behind in search of refuge and the American dream. When we arrived, reaching for the American dream was more difficult than my mother had anticipated. We had to learn a new language and culture, and my mother struggled every day to put food on the table. She spent many of her days working long hours outside washing cars, using rough chemicals that burned her hands, and while working outside in the New England weather, which is very unpredictable and (as this winter has shown) chilling.  Since my mom worked long hours, many times I was tasked with taking care of my brothers while having to focus on my studies, among other obstacles.   Now, college acts as an academic oasis. Here I am consistently engaging my peers in intellectual conversations that push me to think differently. Being surrounded by myriad different people, some of which come from faraway places and stem from various social positions, is a gift. Though it can be difficult at times to have to bear my personal baggage and to navigate this existence with my more affluent peers, I carry my mom’s sacrifices and resilience with me wherever I go, and it acts as a powerful motivator. I have never taken her many sacrifices lightly.  The weight of her strife, along with all of the support from mentors and people over the years, helps me when the pressures that comes along with a college education feel like too much to bear. Likewise, the support you both have given me I shall keep with me moving forward. Without help, there is no telling if I would even be in college now. I make sure to embody the spirit of the collective efforts that have brought me here and to display the same degree of energy and attention I have been given to the work I do. Engaging in my academics in this way has proved fruitful, and last semester I made dean’s list. Though I do not yet know what my major will be (I have a wide range of interests, so choosing is difficult), I aim to honor the dream my mother had in mind when we first landed in Logan back in 2001, along with all of the support I have garnered over the years.   Thank you once again for your donation! It means so much to me, and I won’t let you down!   ",,,,

Being in the U.S. for a year and a half has inspired me to work harder, achieve more and strive to be one of the best in what I do. My first year was full of experiences and so is my second one so far. During the summer, I went to Italy with Northeastern University to study family business, and after that I did an internship in Geneva at the International Telecommunication Union, an organization that works for the United Nations. All this would not have been possible without your help, and I cannot thank you enough.   This semester I am preparing to do my co-op in the spring. I have applied to jobs that are either international affairs related or in the music industry, and I am looking forward to seeing what it is like to work for six months. Luckily enough I will be doing my co-op in Boston, which will allow me to continue my classes at the New England Conservatory in Opera. My passion for music has grown even stronger since last year, and I am thinking of also doing Jazz in the spring.   The financial support that you are offering me was vital for me coming to Northeastern, and this has been the wisest choice I have ever made. I have the chance to live in this beautiful city, to be introduced to the American culture, and at the same time, meet people from all over the world and to realize my dreams – both in the area of academia and in that of music performance.

I am still a Communications major candidate, but I have changed my area of focus from a general one to film. I have taken a lot of film classes these past two years, and I greatly enjoy all aspects of film, whether it be shooting the footage or editing it. This semester alone, I am taking 3 film classes. Courses I have taken that I enjoyed the most have been Television Field Production, Audio Production, Advertising Practices, and Postproduction for Film Editing. Perhaps what I enjoy the most is editing content and making it my own, and personalizing my creation. I hope to one day give this industry a try, specifically production, in either Los Angeles or New York.  The last time I was writing this letter, I spoke of how I was on a co-op search, and two years later, I have successfully completed two. My first was at EF Education, where I was a sales admissions coordinator here in Boston. At EF, I helped place students who wished to learn English at the many EF schools we had around the world. I would communicate directly with them, make their I-20s for visa purposes, and book them in our network. My second co-op, which I just completed this June, was working for Young & Rubicam (advertising) at their headquarters in Manhattan. This opportunity opened up my mind to the creative world, and I saw the different steps that an ad would take, specifically to go from idea to screen. I was a part of Z Academy and learned a great deal about advertising business and production. Now as I search for a job, I hope I will be able to apply what I learned on co-op into the real world post college.  The financial support offered by this scholarship is greatly appreciated, and it is reassuring to know that I have someone who believes in me as I try to make my mark on the Northeastern community and the world. The generosity of Northeastern and yourself has had a great impact in my convincing my sister to come to Northeastern, as well, as she has just started this fall. I hope to keep moving forward and doing the best I can in my final months here.  ",,,,

Furthermore, this will also help me focus more on the opportunities that Northeastern has provided for me, as the several semesters of co-ops at different companies will allow me to make an insightful decision as to what kind of career path I would like to take in the future. I have been on the Dean’s list for many years and I hope to keep that going into my final year. By the end of 2015, I will have been on three co-ops. My first co-op was at GE Aviation in Lynn, MA, where I got my foot wet in the engineering world and I honed on several skills such as teamwork, problem solving and organization. For my second co-op at Qinetiq NA, a robotics defense company in Waltham, MA, I took on a more hands-on technical role in which I applied the engineering concepts I learned from school to the projects I worked on. Finally, on my last co-op, I went back to GE Aviation in Cincinnati, OH, where I not only built upon the skills I learned from my past experiences, but also put focus onto my career path, seeking out career insight from the GE engineers to help me forge my decisions about my future.

I plan to help those who have experienced hardship like me. ,"I want to begin by expressing my deepest gratitude for the financial support that the Nasella Family Endowment Fund is providing me for the 2015-2016 school year. This scholarship has alleviated some of the anxiety that I face every semester while wondering how I will pay for my education. The timing of this scholarship could not have come at a better time, because I am currently scrambling in search of ways to fund the upcoming spring semester. If I have financial holds on my account, I am not able to register for courses with the rest of my peers. As a first generation college student plagued by poverty, I have struggled with the financial aspect of my education. However, I have never allowed this inconvenient truth stand in the way of my pursuit of my goals. As a token of my appreciation, I want to provide you with a brief narrative about myself, so you can truly understand how impactful this scholarship is. My mother dropped out of high school her senior year in order to take care of me. She utilized welfare to support us, but she suffered abuse by my younger brother’s father. After years of abuse, she was finally awarded section 8, low income housing by the welfare office. I remember never feeling comfortable there, having to use water instead of milk in my cereal, and eating ramen noodles every day for dinner. It was not until middle school that I realized how bad we were doing, when I came home to a note on our front door that read, “NOTICE OF EVICTION.” I knew that I had to step up in some type of way, so I got my first job at the age of 12. The local barbershop paid me under the table to sweep the floors and clean the bathroom. I also began to sell candy and chips to my middle school peers by investing the money I made at the barbershop into buying snacks that we all loved. At the age of 12, I developed an amazing work ethic that has followed me through my life.  High School was a little bit tougher for me. While going to school full time, I played basketball, football, and worked at a furniture moving company. The stress of supporting my family overcame me, and it reflected poorly on my grades. Instead of quitting my job, I quit playing sports in order to take on more hours at work. Upon graduation from high school, I could not afford to attend college, so I decided to take a gap year and work for City Year. City Year provided me with extensive training and a scholarship partnership to attend Wheelock College in Boston.  While at Wheelock, I flourished academically and socially. I was a part of many clubs and was a student leader on campus. However, the financial aid that I was receiving fell drastically short. With this in mind, I decided to transfer to Northeastern with the hopes of receiving better financial aid. I have always struggled to pay for my education, and I am taking on student loan debt. I have been told by many to go to a less expensive state school, but I do not feel like I will receive the education or experience necessary for me to accomplish my goals at any other school than Northeastern. I love everything about this school, and the one thing that stands out is the co-op program. I am currently on co-op at the Office of The Massachusetts Attorney General, working in the Community Engagement Division. In my four short months, I have done work that has been beneficial to the office, the citizens of the Commonwealth, and to myself. Once again, I am sincerely grateful for this scholarship. It warms my heart to know that there are people out there who love to help others.  I plan to help those who have experienced hardship like me. Upon graduation, I plan to attend law school. After successful completion of law school and passing the bar, I want to become a Judge Advocate General in the US Navy. Following five to ten years of serving my country, I want to return to Massachusetts or California and work as an Assistant Attorney General in the Policy and Government Division. From here, I would like to work my way up until I can run for some type of public office. I believe that this path will allow me to provide substantive help to those who need it. To this end, this scholarship is fueling the flame of the torch that guides me through the path to success. Thank you.  ",,,,

First and foremost I would like to say thank you so much; this money really means a lot to me. Without it, I would likely have had to take out a decent amount of student loans in order to complete my degree here at Northeastern. I feel incredibly lucky to have received this money and I will always be grateful for what you are giving me. To describe my financial situation to you more clearly, I should probably start my story with Hurricane Sandy. I’m from Long Island (pronounced Lawn Guy Land), so Hurricane Sandy hit my family pretty hard. I distinctly remember watching the water come in and fill my basement with five feet of water while my whole family watched everything unfold in the living room upstairs. Due to the hurricane, all my family’s cars had been destroyed, along with our basement. Also around this time, my dad had lost his job and was also dealing with medical issues as a result of an infection in his foot. He wound up needing to get his leg amputated just below the knee. All of these things put a financial strain on my family as you can imagine. Things have gotten much better since then, but my family is still feeling the effects of those incidents today, which is why the money you are giving to me for school is so important to me.  Regardless of all that stuff, my life has been pretty great. As I mentioned earlier, I’m from Long Island (more specifically Massapequa). I went to Massapequa High School where I played basketball and was part of the marching band (because ladies love a man in uniform). I am currently a 3rd Civil Engineering student at Northeastern. I’m in the middle of my first co-op at Turner Construction where we are working on an apartment building in the Seaport area of Boston. It has been an awesome experience working with everyone there, but for my next co-op I will likely pursue something finance- related as that field is very interesting to me.  Anyways, I hope you enjoyed getting a little insight into my life; it was the least I could do to thank you for what you’ve done for both me and my family. I feel incredibly fortunate that I have received this aid from you and hope that someday I will be successful enough to pay it forward to other students in need. Thank you again.  ",,,,

I chose to attend Northeastern University for its renowned co-op program and because when I came to visit, I felt like this school was a perfect fit. I have done 2 co-ops; one was at a medical device company called J&J DePuySynthes and the other at a metal parts manufacturing company in Italy called Meccanotecnica. These two amazing experiences helped me grow as both a student and a person. I would not have gotten such unique and beneficial work experiences without the top-notch co-op program offered here at NU. I have also been blessed enough to have a work-study position in the engineering office on campus and have been able to make great connections with many professors and advisors.

My name is Alessandra Snigur, and I have recently been chosen as a recipient of a scholarship from the Nasella Family Endowment Fund. I am writing to you today to try to express how sincerely grateful I am for your support. Without this scholarship, my last semester at Northeastern would have put an enormous financial strain on me and could have possibly even prevented me from graduating. Currently, I am a senior at Northeastern working towards my bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering.  I am originally from Warwick, NY, which is a small town located about an hour outside of New York City.  I transferred to Northeastern in 2011 after completing two years at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.  My decision to transfer was a difficult one to make, but I’m happy I made it. When I was considering transferring, I thought back to high school and remembered how much I had loved Northeastern and Boston when I visited. I know now that I chose RPI for the wrong reasons, but I don’t regret a thing. It was a lesson I had to learn, and I met some incredible people, classmates and professors who taught me a lot while I was there. I also learned how to build an industrial-strength marshmallow launcher, which is not something a lot of people can put on their résumé.  Unfortunately, six months after transferring to Northeastern, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.  Luckily, my doctor, who is as brilliant as she is thorough, diagnosed me early. As a result, I was able to finish my semester before getting surgery. My professors and classmates were more supportive than I could have ever imagined. At the time, I was also working about 30 hours a week at a relatively well-known upscale bar in Cambridge, and I received a heart-wrenching amount of support from the Boston restaurant industry as well.  I realized that year how tight-knit and amazing the city of Boston is.  It was this experience that subsequently led me to my current co-op at the Healthcare Systems Engineering Institute, a firm run by Northeastern professor Dr. Jim Benneyan. While I was running all over the city to see different doctors, I realized that the discrepancy in care between what I was receiving in Boston and what I had received in rural New York was blaring.  It was very clear to me that the differences in care were the result of bad systems, and it led me to the nascent and upcoming field of healthcare systems engineering. I’ve always wanted to be lawyer, and at work, I’m always the one advocating for the patient perspective. It’s just the way that I am. After graduation, I am planning on taking a gap year to travel and then attend law school. Without this scholarship, I would not have been able to manage my medical bills and my tuition. Thanks to you and your generosity, I will be able to graduate, get myself back on track, and continue my education in graduate school. Thank you will never be good enough. I can only hope that someday I will be in the position to help someone as you have helped me.  ",,,,

I’ve definitely enjoyed this co-op and I plan on continuing to pursue a job in finance. Currently I have been applying for summer analyst programs in equity research. I’ve been interviewing with Credit Suisse and am currently waiting to see if I will be invited down to their super day. A lot of my free time has been spent studying for the CFA level I (which I will be taking in December) so things have been pretty hectic lately. I’m looking forward to Christmas time when I will hopefully have everything sorted out.This spring I will be taking my capstone project for civil engineering. I have a focus in structural engineering, so my capstone team will be designing a high rise building alongside a group from the architecture school. Although I don’t think I want to pursue a career in engineering any longer, I am actually pretty excited to get started on this project. I think it will be pretty cool to apply everything I’ve learned over the years to a project of relatively large scale.Anyway, that’s pretty much what has been going on with me. I’m really grateful for all that you have done for me. Not having to worry about paying off a huge amount of student loans has relieved a lot of stress for me; I feel extremely fortunate that I received this scholarship. As mentioned before, I really hope everything is well with you and thank you again.",,,,

I am a 19-year-old Syrian girl and a recent and current beneficiary of the Nassar Family Scholarship Fund.  I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you, under whose kindness and benevolence I now have this golden opportunity. Thanks to yourself, I now am a sophomore at Northeastern University, and I believe it is the right path for me, a gateway to greater opportunities in life.  I am eternally grateful for this scholarship, which removes the financial difficulty that initially stopped me from enrolling at Northeastern University. Due to all the unfortunate events that happened in Syria, my parents sacrificed their work and home to provide for my brother and me a safer future. They decided to move to Dubai four years ago, to bring us into an environment where we could have a chance to follow our dreams. Unfortunately, at the expense of living a peaceful life, my family's financial status deteriorated constantly during our stay in Dubai. Therefore, initially I was pessimistic, because even if I got admission to my dream university, it still might have been impossible to continue my studies there, given the tuition fees. But the moment I saw that I received the paper saying that I got a scholarship, my heart dropped.  Moving to Dubai proved to be an expensive affair that further complicated our financial situation; however, it exposed me to grand opportunities, whether in academics, social interactions, or life in general. That movement also indirectly exposed me to the ultimate opportunity; this scholarship which heralds an amazingly positive turnaround in my life. This scholarship now affords me the best quality education.  Once again, thank you so much for the scholarship, but also, thank you for the inspiration.  I hope to utilize this grand opportunity given to me to gain all the skills I can under my majors, Computer Science and Business Administration. My objective is not just to do my best in my university academics, but to use the skills gained here to contribute to the technological advancement and transformation of society, and to hopefully help people with the endless possibilities Computer Science can offer. My ultimate goal in life is to make a change. I want to emerge as a remarkable figure in the history of Computer Science, and I am sure the path I am on is the one that will take me to happiness and success.

My professors, service-learning experiences, and co-ops have all served to make this an amazing journey. I could not have reached this final stage in my education at Northeastern University without your support.","I have proudly gone through most of my time at Northeastern as a human services and international affairs combined major. It has been a pleasure to have such passionate and knowledgeable professors. I have been lucky enough to study abroad and to participate in the co-op program twice. I am even making plans to complete a final international co-op. Sometimes I still cannot believe that I am so close to graduating.  Before my father passed away in 2001, he worked hard to ensure that I had good education opportunities. After he moved our family from Haiti to America, I was enrolled in a small private school in Orange, New Jersey. I learned to speak English and developed a love for gothic novels that manipulated the language so well. Unfortunately, my father’s death propelled my mother and me into poverty. My mom could no longer afford a child on a housekeeper’s salary.So, I was sent to live with relatives in Florida, where I attended an overcrowded public school. Even though safety was questionable, I remained at the institution because it was within walking distance from my new home. Back in New Jersey, my mom got a new job as a certified nurse’s aid. It was similar to a housekeeper’s job, but the two-dollar pay increase made the work more tolerable.  The new job provided enough money for my mom to support us both. I moved back to New Jersey in the middle of sixth grade. I was enrolled in a local private school, chosen because it did not add too much strain to our finances. I entered high school in 2009. Again, the school was chosen because of cheapness. I travelled to Newark, New Jersey, five days a week for my education. The neighborhood was not ideal, but the people were great. In my senior year, my history teacher encouraged me to apply to Northeastern University. After 11 years of paying for schooling, my mother sat me down and explained that I would be paying for college on my own.Choosing to attend Northeastern was not an easy decision. I have spent my whole life dangerously close to the poverty line. I applied to Northeastern thinking that the school was too good for me. However, when I visited the college for the first time, I was overwhelmed by the possibility for a better life. My parents worked hard for several years to give me a fighting chance. The least I could do was go after the best opportunity being offered to me. So, I picked Northeastern and decided to do whatever it took to graduate. Before he died, my father managed to save enough money for me to pay for three semesters at Northeastern. Once the money ran out, I decided to get clever with my pattern of attendance. In 2011, I started my first co-op. My plan was to save enough money to get me into the following semester. In the process, I fell in love with the job. I was working as a paraeducator for Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center. My main duties were caring for children with mental and physical disabilities. I used their individualized education plans to teach them basic math, reading, and writing skills.Although I greatly enjoyed my co-op at Crotched Mountain, I knew that I did not want to pursue a career as paraeducator. To me, the role was too limited. I spent the next couple of years at Northeastern not knowing what I wanted to do with my life. Luckily, this semester, I enrolled in the “International Conflict and Negotiation” course taught by Professor Kimberly Jones. A few weeks into the course I realized that I had stumbled upon my career path. I want to work to keep states accountable to their citizens. I want to ensure that everyone enjoys basic rights, such as the right to education.Attending Northeastern has definitely shaped me as a person. Graduating from this university will reinforce my belief that hard work does pay off. I have never regretted coming to Northeastern University.

I intend to make you extremely proud as I continue my journey! Thank you again!,"My name is Tara Howard, and I am one of the scholarship recipients from the Northeastern Black Alumni Scholarship Fund for the 2016-2017 academic year. Let me first start by saying thank you! I am from Canton, Massachusetts, and I am a fifth-year student at Northeastern with a Criminal Justice and Human Services major and a minor in Sociology. I am also a Ujima Scholar and the President of the Northeastern Black Student Association. The biggest reason I chose to come to Northeastern was because of the co-op program, and since I’ve been here I’ve completed two so far: one in the Victim Compensation and Assistance Division at the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office and the other with the Massachusetts Firearms Records Bureau. During the scholarship lunch you and I had a conversation about what I wanted to do after graduation, and when I left the Institute that day, my mind was racing. I kept thinking to myself, “Tara, you have to get it together, it’s almost May.” But after our conversation about my first co-op, I realized what I really wanted to do after graduation, and that is to work with victims. The way that I discussed how passionate I was about working with victims solidified this for me. As a Criminal Justice major, many expect that I want to be a lawyer or a cop, but I don’t want to be either. I actually want to work with victims after I graduate, because I feel like the criminal justice system forgets about the victims of crime. I would like to express how much this scholarship means to my family and me. A couple years ago my father had a stroke, so he was out of work for some time, and my mother was the main source of income for our family. My father is now back at work, but not full-time. I really would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for providing me with this scholarship so I can continue my education here at Northeastern. I intend to make you, the Board, and the rest of the black community at Northeastern extremely proud as I continue my journey! Thank you again!",,,,

","My name is Monica Johnson, and due to your wonderful support, I was selected to be a recipient of the Northeastern Black Alumni Scholarship. As a mixed girl from New Hampshire, I have always wanted to go to college in a culture- and opportunity-rich area, which is one of many reasons I chose to attend Northeastern University. As a freshman, getting involved has been overwhelming and somewhat of a challenge, however the African-American Institute and alumni have time and time again welcomed me with open arms. Coming from a lower-income family with drug abuse present, I have always had a natural need to help others.This instinct continues to guide my life, as well as my college and career goals. As a philosophy and political science double major, I hope to use my experiences to make a difference in the world. I have recently decided to pick up a minor in Human Services, as well. I intend to use these classes and skills learned to be an advocate for those in need, particularly minority and low-income individuals. While I am unsure if my path will lead me to law school or nonprofit work, I hope to play a role in stopping the many injustices seen today in our country and world.As a member of Northeastern Black Student Association (NBSA), it has been really helpful and comforting to see and talk to people who have come from similar situations as myself. Many of them have been very supportive and helpful in integrating me to the school as well as what organizations might be interesting to me. That being said, I have found an interest in the Students Against Institutional Discrimination (SAID) group, and hope to expand my knowledge further. This scholarship will allow me to do that and so much more. When applying to schools, financial aid was constantly a main factor, and thankfully Northeastern helped. However, this scholarship in particular has made me less stressed about day-to-day financials. I am funding my education by myself, and knowing that I am being supported not only comforts me, but allows me to focus on why I came here – to further my education. This scholarship has also made it possible for me to take a Dialogue of Civilizations class this upcoming summer. This scholarship was about far more than just money, and I am beyond appreciative for being selected. It will allow me to pursue opportunities and expand my ability to join organizations and help the school and community like I have planned and wanted to.

I am a graduate of Long Beach Polytechnic High School – Home of Scholars and Champions – in Long Beach, California.  I am currently a middler studying Finance and Accounting.

I hope to one day make a lasting effect on the world and go down in history as someone who positively changed millions of lives. KPMG is a great foundation for my goal, because it sets me on a path where I will be able to gather the resources necessary to make such a change. This perspective I owe to my mother and community back home. I have been taught to view life as a cycle of giving back to those less fortunate. In today’s time this could not be more pertinent.When I learned that I was a recipient of this scholarship, I was ecstatic, albeit slightly less than my mother, who always set the bar high and believes in me 100%. This support allows me to direct more time to my studies and less to my part-time job. Now I don’t have to worry about my phone bill, textbooks, or rent. It helps me gain some financial flexibility, which has been so rare in my life. Again, I am humbled and grateful for your generosity.   can assure you that you will not regret blessing me with this scholarship. It will join my bag of catalysts that drive me to be great and make my family and community proud. Thank you so much.",,,,

Living in a city that is more than 2,500 years old gives you the chance to visit museums in the weekends, walk around in beautiful cobblestone streets, and accidentally stumble upon statues that have been there for thousands of years!  My classes abroad were very interesting, it was pleasant to engage with an Italian student body and see the world from their eyes.  As a business major, my courses varied from Marketing, International Finance, to Strategic Decisions in Entrepreneurship, while my electives were Public Speaking, and Italian. I thoroughly enjoyed learning another language and using my knowledge as soon as I left the classroom. Taking Italian also proved very helpful when I volunteered at a Women’s Center, where I helped the local Community learn English. I truly enjoyed my time with them and I learned a lot about their country through our exchanges.  Another course which I thoroughly enjoyed and learned a lot from was Public Speaking.  My professor, a previous British Diplomat and Theater actor, was devoted in teaching us the crucial skills one needs to develop in order to deliver impactful speeches. Furthermore, my business classes were interesting and informing as always. It was valuable and insightful too learn Marketing and Entrepreneurship through an Italian lens and to learn about International Finance while studying abroad. This was another semester in which I achieved high grades, hence allowing me to be on the Dean’s List for the sixth consecutive semester. Upon returning to the US, I accepted my second Co-Op as a Financial Analyst at TJX. I am truly enjoying my time here and I am learning a lot. I enjoy working on my own projects and analyzing feasible ways to improve sales projections or working on Pro Forma models. I have the chance to see how what I learn in my finance classes applies in the real world. The possibilities in the world of finance are endless, while in Co-Op I have the chance to explore some of those opportunities.  I can see myself working in corporate finance in the future or perhaps consulting. Currently, I am also working part-time at a social enterprise startup known as ScholarJet. The company was founded by two fellow Northeastern students; I work on the financial and business development side of the firm. The mission of ScholarJet is to provide students with action based scholarships in order to fund their education. We want to help students tackle the problem of debt and fund their education through action oriented scholarships. I feel that my work will have a powerful impact, I am grateful to people like you who have inspired me to give back in my own way. I truly appreciate everything you are doing for me and I wanted to thank you for your support. I am very grateful that I have the opportunity to attend a university like Northeastern because of your grand generosity and financial support. You are truly helping me achieve my own American Dream! I was born in a small Eastern European Country, where the opportunities are scarce and the resources are limited. Fortunately, my future is bright and I am receiving a world-class education, which will set me in the right quest as I carve out my path in life. Your generosity and financial support are granting me the opportunities I need in order to reach my full potential in life. I hope that my bright future allows me to achieve my aspirations of helping people in the ways that you are helping me!  ",,,,

I am writing because I would like to extend my utmost gratitude for being a recipient of the Peter Cameron Scholarship Fund. I was enormously pleased when I found out that I would be awarded the scholarship another year. I am currently a junior at Northeastern, and I plan do one more co-op and one more semester, then graduate next December. The more time I spend at Northeastern, the more I realize that this is such a wonderful school with amazing opportunities. Receiving this scholarship has greatly eased the financial burden that comes along with attending Northeastern for me.  I am studying Marketing and Social Enterprise, and I hope to pursue a career with a primary focus on social impact. I would love to work for a mission-driven organization that is focused on making a positive change in society. One of the causes I care very deeply about is education. I feel very blessed to be able to attend such a great school like Northeastern and to be able to attend college at all. I am very passionate about learning how we can make education more accessible and equitable to people around the globe, as I truly believe education is the key to the future.I did my most recent and second co-op at an educational technology startup called Fullbridge in Downtown Crossing. They create classes on an online platform that are focused on professional development in young adults, with the end goal of closing the workforce gap. This was a wonderful experience, as I learned a lot about working for a startup, education technology, and other technical skills. This semester, I am quite involved on campus. I was selected to work with Northeastern’s venture accelerator, IDEA, as social media manager. I am very excited about this as I am very interested in entrepreneurship and think that Northeastern has a great community surrounding it. I am looking forward to what lies ahead with IDEA!One of my favorite classes that I am taking this semester is Social Responsibility in the Age of Inequality. This class fulfills my social enterprise minor, and I am very passionate about everything we talk about. There is a strong focus on what businesses can do to positively impact not just their profits, but also their communities and the world – including the environment. We have many insightful discussions and people express many perspectives. I believe that the variety of perspectives one can find at Northeastern is another thing that makes it so great.In conclusion, I would like to thank you again for this scholarship. As I am paying my own tuition in full, as well as my rent, this is a huge weight off of my shoulders. At one point, I was working over 60 hours a week with my co-op and waitressing job to save money for school and rent. I now have a job that lets me work from home since I am in classes, but I still work 30 hours a week for that while in class full time. I really understand the value of this scholarship and will appreciate it very much throughout the duration of my time at Northeastern and beyond.",,,,

It feels sweeter than the first time because it is nice knowing that I can graduate next year without accruing more financial debt. With your continued support, I will have my senior year fully covered. The first time I wrote this thank you letter, I was in South Africa on my research internship. This time, I am currently in New York finishing up my final internship before graduating in May 2017. From the first time I wrote this letter to you, so much has changed for me. I was able to ace many of my prerequisites for medical school, in particular, Genetics and Organic Chemistry. With your continued support, I am fully motivated to finish off strong in excelling in my remaining prerequisites: Biochemistry and Physics 2.  This scholarship has been a continued blessing in my life, and I am so grateful that I can tell my parents that they do not have to pay for anything for my final year of school. I will be able to tell them that because of your continued support through this fund. Hopefully one day I’ll be able to write another letter to you, but it will be from medical school to show you that your support helped a student to reach his dreams. I also hope that one day that I will be able to meet you to thank you in person, but for now, from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you for your continued support in funding for this scholarship.",,,,

Gryzmish Law Student Fund. It is greatly appreciated, as it allows students like me to obtain the unique academic experience that Northeastern University School of Law offers. I chose to attend NUSL because I wanted to experience the co-op program to attain one year of full time experience. Upon graduation, I plan to become an Assistant District Attorney in one of the five boroughs in New York City, and ultimately a federal prosecutor. Currently, I am interning at the Bronx District Attorney’s Office in the Child Abuse and Sexual Assault Unit. This generous support on behalf of your fund helped me throughout my internship this past summer 2015, when I was a legal intern at the Passaic County Prosecutor’s Office in the Trial Unit. During this internship, I was assigned to an Assistant Prosecutor where I assisted in various legal research and writing tasks, including, but not limited to, Motions to Suppress Evidence, Post-Conviction Relief Petitions, PreTrial Miranda, and Wade Memorandums of Law. I also assisted in victim/witness interviews and plea negotiations with defense attorneys. I was also able to attend seminars and various training presentations in several facets of criminal, family, and civil law. This internship solidified my desire to become a prosecutor, and I am excited to take what I have learned in this internship and apply it to subsequent internships and my career post-graduation. Through this internship, I was able to gain a foundational basis of knowledge of the inner workings of the courtroom and the daily duties and responsibilities of prosecutors. I also learned that I have a desire to work in a unit of a prosecutor’s office that handles cases involving domestic violence victims and/or child abuse victims. Being the product of a single parent household, this support impacts not only my life, but my family’s life as well. Throughout my childhood and my younger brother’s childhood, our mother stressed the importance of education and has worked tirelessly to—and has successfully enabled—her children to receive a private school education by herself. Her accomplishment of course has not come without “This support impacts not only my life, but my family’s life as well.” “I learned that I have a desire to work in a unit of a prosecutor’s office that handles cases involving domestic violence victims and/or child abuse victims.” 10 adversity.

I participated in Teach for America in New York City for two years as a seventh grade special education teacher and then moved on to become a Legal Investigator for the New York City Department of Education’s Special Education Legal Unit. I chose to attend Northeastern to pursue a career in special education legal advocacy and policy.  During my Co-Op experience at DLC, I have had the opportunity to work closely with several attorneys on many youth advocacy issues. Specifically, I conducted client intakes, investigated allegations against school districts, completed file reviews, and attended mediation sessions. I also drafted demand letters, hearing requests, and discovery responses for special education cases. Additionally, I conducted research for DLC’s comments on the proposed legislation to ban prone restraints in schools. The direct experience with clients, experts and the legal system has been invaluable to my development as a legal professional.  Additionally, DLC’s Co-Op provided me with the opportunity to sharpen my research and writing skills. Along with smaller research projects, I wrote two office memos. The first highlighted the disparities between legal protections under Section 504 and IDEA, and the second explored Chapter 222’s impact on students with disabilities in school discipline. The memos not only strengthened my legal skills, but will be resources for DLC’s attorneys moving forward.

Your generosity has allowed me to pursue a very fulfilling, public interest co-op, one which has greatly furthered my legal education. I am from Springfield, Massachusetts, and obtained my undergraduate degree at Boston University. After graduating from BU, I felt strongly that another Boston institution, Northeastern University School of Law, was the right place for me to pursue a juris doctor. I was intrigued by Northeastern’s dedication to public service, as well as its emphasis on equipping students, through cooperative legal education, with the practical skills necessary to become an effective attorney. My second co-op, in the Winter of 2014, was at the U.S. Department of Labor, for the Administrative Law Judges, here in Boston. I drafted decisions and orders arising under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act and the federal whistleblower statutes, performed legal research, and observed trials and hearings. This experience sparked a keen interest in both government work and labor and employment law. I have since taken other employment-law centric co-ops and plan to pursue a career in the field of labor and employment law after graduating from law school. I would like to reiterate my deep appreciation for the financial support of the Reuben B. Gryzmish Law Student Fund. It allowed me to take an otherwise-unpaid co-op, one pivotal in providing me direction regarding the type of law I wish to pursue.

Once again, I would just like to express my immense gratitude and let you know a little bit about what I have been up to over the last few months. Over the summer I had an amazing experience working as an intern to Justice Geraldine Hines at the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. Not only is Justice Hines one of the smartest people I have met, but she, her clerk, and everyone I met at the Court was unusually nice. It was a really pleasant work environment and I feel like I learned a lot about a lot of different areas of law and about legal procedure as well. Every day that I went to work, I would just look in awe at the beauty of the John Adams Courthouse and marvel at the privilege of working with amazing people in the oldest appellate court in the Western Hemisphere. I am not sure if I had mentioned my plans when we last had dinner, but I took a few weeks off after coop and managed to head off to St. Paul where I studied for the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE – an ethics exam which is essentially the first step towards the bar next year), among other things. I am happy to report that I passed! Now, we are at the end of another quarter. I just finished my immigration exam this morning and I will be working with a small immigration law firm here in Boston over the Winter Quarter. The quarter went really quickly, probably because I was taking courses that I really enjoyed. In addition to Immigration Law and Procedure, I took Labor Law I (with Karl Klare, who you might know), International and Foreign Legal Research, and an independent study with Dean Danielsen on International Trade Law. As graduation inches closer, I am excited to be almost done! I am ready to head back to work, trying to figure out how to use the law and my anthropology background to do some good in the world! Right now I am in the process of applying for fellowships in human rights and public interest litigation. We’ll see how it goes! Have a wonderful rest of the month and a wonderful Thanksgiving!",,,,

I am showing them that anything is possible and also teaching them my life motto: don’t let your setbacks cause you to sit back.,"Thank you for your donation through the Edmond J. and Maureen J. English Scholars Fund and all that you do for the Torch Scholars program at Northeastern University. I am honored to be a beneficiary. Growing up I lived primarily with a single parent, my mother. My father walked out of my life when I was very young. I would often call and write to my father begging him to come back home, but in spite of my best efforts nothing seemed to work. Due to his absence, my mother had to fulfill both parental roles and take on a larger financial burden. Having 5 sons meant that money was very limited for my mother. I grew up in Uphams Corner, Dorchester where violence, drugs, and a lack of opportunity often discourage young men from striving to be their very best. However, despite the circumstances, my mother had provided a structure and support that far too many of those within my community lacked. Examining my life, I recognized that I desired to create change for my family and others living in urban communities. When applying to college I was immediately drawn towards Northeastern because of its focus on, and subsequent ability to, prepare students for the real world. Not many schools provide co-op and dialogue of civilization opportunities like the ones at Northeastern. These experiences, which I plan to partake in, will allow me to positively be challenged yet gain valuable lessons that will be beneficial to my character development and success. I was also interested in attending Northeastern because I can take the lessons learned and apply it to the same community in which I grew up. Giving back is a value that I cherish. From the age of 14 when I began serving my community as a community organizer at The City School, up to now, I have faithfully served my community and I plan to do that by still being present in Boston. I remember when I learned that I was accepted into Northeastern as a Torch Scholar. I was at my mentor’s house wearing a green button-down shirt and tie putting my hands to my face out of excitement. It meant the world to me because it lifted a financial burden that may have otherwise prohibited me from attending this marvelous institution. This opportunity is truly a blessing and I am now paving the way for my brothers and those within my community. I am showing them that anything is possible and also teaching them my life motto: don’t let your setbacks cause you to sit back. Currently I am freshman majoring in Political Science and Criminal Justice with a minor in African-American Studies while on a Pre-Law track. I am drawn to these studies because after becoming a vocal champion for reform throughout my high school years I plan to one day become Mayor of the City of Boston. My experience of speaking with President Barack Obama at a roundtable discussion, presenting a speech at The White House, and being featured on CNN, New York Times, NPR, and the Bay State Banner have all demonstrated what I am capable of. These encounters are what motivated me to aim for the stars in everything that I do. Now as I set goals for myself, I plan to one day obtain a law degree from the illustrious Harvard University, then further my education by receiving a PhD in Social Science. Had I not received the Torch Scholarship to enter Northeastern I do not know where I would be. I will continue maximizing every opportunity that comes my way in life. I am excited to see where my Northeastern journey will bring me in life. It is because of you that I stand on the grounds of Northeastern University. Thank you!  ",,,,

I'm sad to leave, but I'm prepared to go and when I come back to walk across that stage in May... The whole world will see what all of you have prepared me for. ","I hope you both have been doing great since we last met. As I enter my last semester at Northeastern, I just want to share, with you, some of the great things that have came out of 2016. This spring, I had the opportunity to do a wonderful coop at Northeastern's University Registrar and, although many people think poorly of it as a coop, I had the time of my life there. I learned so much about what it means to be in unison as a school, how a school can function and how staff are able to help, support, and direct students. As an English Major with an education focus and a future educational leader, I think this coop was very beneficial to my focus.  It was very eye opening and I was able to critique and learn from Northeastern on what a great school does or can look like. Since I knew how to function so well at NU, as a learning institution, my coop advisor asked me to stay for an additional two months, making it an 8 month coop. During that extension of coop, I also branched out into more direct routines of my field. I am a current student leader of Success Boston and during a meeting my sister and I spoke with the BPS school superintendent, Dr. Chang. From that conversation, both my sister and I earned an internship working with BPS over the summer. During this internship, we worked and we are still working on building a future teacher network of color. In this network we want to reach out to all minority groups and encourage them to teach and/or work in education, as well as break the stigma around teaching. Not ALL states pay teachers well, but Boston teachers and educators get paid fairly well and we want more people of color to know about that. We also want them to know the value in the job and how having a balanced staff that also represents people who look like BPS students in our school is significantly important and beneficial to a student's learning. Our goal is to recruit people from high school (juniors & seniors) and people in college. We want to help them become part of an organization that will help them grow as educators and leaders. Because school is in session, we are still in the works, but when we do officially launch it I will definitely let you both know. I also took on a leadership role within the College of Social Science (CCSH) . I am on an advisory board that has been working to make the CSSH a more desired college of study and a more experiential college. This has been great because I could use what I learned from coop and apply my critics to the college that I am part of. The next few months will hopefully bring a lot more change and praise within the CSSH community. In addition to this, I'm still dancing and stepping! Kinematix has treated me well these last few years. I have danced in competitions I could have never imagined. This year is my last Funktion ( a show that we host on Nov 5th) and it's going to be one of the most memorable experiences performing with my team. Stepping on another level (SOAL) has also treated me very well. I'm still the VP, step captain, and treasure of the group, but this year I have learned how to really manage my roles as a leader of this group. This semester we recruited such a dynamic and lively group and they are making my last semester on SOAL one full of laughter. We also have a few completions this year and one of them will Break the Stage, which will be another memorable last experience. I am truly grateful for the Teams and the friends that have come out of them. The crazy thing is I'm still not finished haha. On top of all the organizations I am part of I also have a teaching job at The Kwong Kow Chinese School. I am working there everyday, but part time. I teach 5th grade and 6th grade English and I work specifically with reading comprehension, verbal reasoning and vocabulary. The purpose of my classes are to prepare students for the ISEE exam, which students take to get into Boston's exam schools. It has honestly been a struggle teaching with kids so young, but also working with so many kids whose cultural identities differ so distinctly. I've had issues where students have insulted me because they know nothing about black culture, which is fine because I understand the ignorance, but I feel like no one should be ignorant to being ""culturally sensitive."" From my entire experience at Northeastern I have learned that culture helps people learn the world and learning the world helps people learn how to function in the world, which is exactly what teachers do. For this reason, I want to apply for the FullBright Scholarship in August. I know it's a really competitive scholarship but I believe in myself, what I want to do and what I'm doing. I want to use the scholarship to do a creative project abroad. With this project I want to study different cultures through folk music & dance, games, songs and also the modernity of each culture. I want to document these learnings and share them with the rest my learning communities and bring them into schools to help students become culturally and ethnically intelligent. I'm currently in trying to build a creative portfolio and i’ll give you updates on that too. After that, I will go to graduate school and get my license to teach in the state of Massachusetts. I know I probably went on for a long time, but it's because I want you to see how much you mean to me. I know we send you a letter every year, but after I graduate I will continue to send you letters, so you can continue to see how much you have made a difference in my life. I am confident, I am vibrant, I am in love with this world and the impact I can make on the people in it. I loved being a bear at Dorchester academy and I never thought I could feel another way about a school, but Northeastern has topped the amount of love I have for my education. I am so grateful and so proud to have been under the wing and grace of your sponsorship. I honestly couldn't have asked for two better people to care about my future without even knowing me at first. Northeastern has left its mark on me, you have left your mark on me and I hope that my existence and work will continue to do the same in return. I will really miss this school and the amazing people and experiences that I have came in contact with.I'm sad to leave, but I'm prepared to go and when I come back to walk across that stage in May... The whole world will see what all of you have prepared me for. ",,,,

English Scholars fund. I cannot begin to tell you how much your donation has impacted my life. Since the moment I learned that I would move to the United States, my dream has always been to get an education so that I can help those who were less fortunate in Liberia. It has been more than two years since I received the scholarship and I still wake up every day feeling fortunate and blessed. For a long time in High School I never thought college was a possibility because my family simply could not afford to pay for two people to attend college.  My father was already paying a portion of my sister’s tuition and could not afford to pay both our tuitions. I thought I would never get the chance to pursue a degree in higher education, and bring help to those who couldn’t afford to help themselves. With your helping hands and the grace of God, my dream has been invigorated I once again have the opportunity to fulfill the aura of responsibility that I’ve carried with me since I was a child.   An alumnus of Brighton High School, I am currently a middler majoring in Economics with a minor in International Affairs at Northeastern University. Along with academics I am also a member of the Northeastern Black Student Association where I serve as the cultural liaison, helping facilitate collaboration with other clubs on campus and hosting events that bring the campus together.   I am also extremely excited to tell you that I am currently doing my first co-op experience at Reebok International Ltd. as an assistant Business Analyst. This experience has taught me a lot about the corporate setting and also gave me insight into what I want to do in the future. My experience in this position and with this company has been nothing short of outstanding with my boss acknowledging the great work I have done and even going far as presenting my work at the Global Market Meeting that is held annually at Reebok to preview products that will be launched in the future. As this experience comes to an end I have already began to prepare myself for my next experience by creating a co-op in Liberia where I will be a finance assistant for a local non-profit called The Bush Chicken.  Once again I would I would like to thank you both so much for having such kind hearts, and for the faith you have placed in me to succeed. I may never be able to repay you for you great donation but I can promise you that I will work my hardest to ensure that you assistance does not go to waste. God Bless.   ",,,,

Your investment in the Torch program is allowing me and my Torch classmates to accomplish our dreams. Your contributions to Torch has given me the opportunity to attend college with the hope to not only develop professionally but also become a better individual.   I am extremely excited to inform you that I am in the process of completing my seventh academic semester at Northeastern. My classes this semester include Advanced Writing in Science (which is my last writing course), Laboratory in Biological Psychology, Behavioral Genetics, and Behavioral Endocrinology. Although these classes may feel overwhelming at times due to their dense material, I still enjoy all my courses. There are so many new and fascinating things that I am learning, such as the study of genes that affect our behavior and hormones that affect our development and behavior. These classes enlighten me on current studies which are developing a better understanding of the human brain and behaviors. Additionally, these classes are giving me the chance to explore different areas within my academic field that I can potentially focus on in the future.   In addition to exploring my academic interest this semester, I am also exploring my career goals. I am currently in the process of applying for my second Co-op. During my last Co-op, I had the opportunity to work with the Neurosurgical Research team in Mass General Hospital which taught me a lot about my career and personal interests. This Co-op helped me develop an interest and appreciation towards the research field. This experience along with new knowledge I am gaining in my courses have influenced my decision to continue exploring the research field for my second Co-op. Right now I am searching and applying for different research opportunities within the neuroscience field. I am hoping that my next Co-op experience will help me develop my professional skills as a scientist. I know that these opportunities to explore and develop are because of your generosity.

It is an honor to enter a network of Fung Scholars & Fellows and become one of the inaugural Northeastern University members. Growing up in a multicultural family in Kazakhstan I have always aspired to pursue studies abroad. Now as a fourth year International Business major (concentration: Finance & Insurance, minors: Mathematics, German) at Northeastern, I am convinced that this was the perfect choice for me. Northeastern University’s global orientation, experiential learning commitment, and international connections are the factors that attracted me and ultimately made my academic and professional experiences truly valuable and unique. A strong passion for discovering mystery behind numbers, dating back to high school mathematics research, led me to choosing Finance as my concentration. An assistant professor, Anahit Mkrtchyan, was the one who reassured and expanded my interest in that area. She also served as a mentor for my independent research project, sponsored by the Northeastern University Scholars Program. The director of the program, Dr. Jonna Iacono, was another tremendously helpful resource for me at Northeastern to define my academic path and career plans. I aspire to become a strong global manager focusing on the financial side of organizations and eventually reaching executive level. The added complexity of the international context combined with highly analytical tasks is what I am looking for in my professional life. I believe that my past and upcoming practical experiences in the industry will be able to serve as a solid foundation to accomplish my career goals. In my first co-op I had an opportunity to perform tasks of high-visibility and importance as well as conduct my own project as a financial analyst intern at Amazon.com in Seattle, WA. This job required me not only to adapt to a steep learning curve, but also to develop cross-team communication skills, thus making the experience invaluable for my development as a professional. Before this co-op I also had a chance to work for Procter & Gamble in Kazakhstan and learn the business specifics in a developing market. The next experiential step for my degree is a co-op in Germany, where I am currently finishing an academic semester at a partner school. For this co-op I will be working as an intern in the Valuation & Business Modelling department of the Transaction Advisory Services division of EY (formerly known as Ernst and Young) in Stuttgart. In this role, I will be able to assist the team in deriving value for the company and be exposed to working with clients as well as have an opportunity to conduct independent improvement projects for the team. I am looking forward to learning about an area of finance that is new for me as well as experience a new culture and deal with its challenges in a professional context. With the help of the generous contribution of the Fung Foundation, I will be able to make this experience even more valuable and rewarding. I am also truly excited to be able to connect with other Fung Scholars & Fellows through the expansive network that the Fung Foundation established in the past nine years since the initiation of the Fung Scholarship. I hope to be able to serve as an ambassador and a contributor to this unique program and its community. I express my most sincere gratitude to the",,,,

","My name is Kimberly Hersch, and I am a fourth-year Northeastern University student majoring in International Business with a concentration in Accounting and focusing on the East Asian Studies track. I am originally from South Florida, but I am currently located in Hong Kong, as I am carrying out my expatriate year with a semester at the University of Hong Kong followed by a global co-op experience. Such exciting experiential learning opportunities are what led me to choose to attend Northeastern. While at Northeastern, I have been able to give back to the local community in the form of Service-Learning and the Civic Engagement Program. I have also been encouraged to participate in academic research and actively participate in my field through an Internal Auditing co-op at Hasbro. Northeastern has also allowed me to explore the world through a Dialogue of Civilizations to Kunming, China, where I studied Mandarin and Chinese culture, and now through a semester of study abroad at the University of Hong Kong’s Faculty of Business and Economics. The next step, an accounting co-op in Hong Kong at Hasbro Far East’s Internal Auditing department, has been made possible through your generous funding of the Fung Scholarship. I was fortunate to spend my first co-op with Internal Audit at Hasbro’s global headquarters in Rhode Island. Now, I view this next co-op as a case study in how a country’s work culture can impact a business, as I will be able to directly see how my workplace’s culture makes my experience different within the same department and company. I hope that this experience will help develop my understanding of the Asian work environment, as I will not only be auditing Hong Kong, but will also possibly travel to other offices in the Asia/Pacific region to perform audits. I am particularly interested in viewing the impact of culture on business ethics and learning more about International Financial Reporting Standards. Additionally, I will have the opportunity to see how an American-based multi-national firm operates in order to meld a foreign culture with the standards of an American-based business. I am incredibly excited to pursue this opportunity and continue my development of Chinese knowledge and International Business competencies through hands-on experiential learning and travel. After graduation, I plan to further pursue accounting in a global setting by working for a multi-national company that allows me to employ my knowledge of Mandarin and China. I hope to work in a position that allows me to travel internationally, especially to China, and to work with other managers in offices outside the United States. By co-oping in Hong Kong, I hope to develop the skills necessary to become a global manager. I am honored to be welcomed as a Fung Scholar and hope to contribute to the community of students, both in Boston and in Hong Kong during and after the completion of my co-op, in order to become a part of this growing international network of driven students and future leaders.

It is truly heartwarming that there are people like you out there that truly care for helping others.,"My name is Jonathan J. Adorno, and I am a proud member of the 10th Torch class.  I was born in Puerto Rico and at the age of 4 my family moved to New York. Being that my parents only spoke Spanish and did not have college degrees, the original transition to living within the continental United States was quite difficult. I saw how my parents, especially my father, ended up working many long hours, most of which were overnight. Essentially there were times where I did not even see my father for days due to the amount of time he worked. Seeing all this effort my parents made to be able to provide my two siblings and me a good life made me realize that I had to go to college. I had to go to college because I did not want to worry about working arduous days and nights to be able to provide just enough or only a bit more to my family. I want to be able to have more than enough money to help my own future family and pay back my parents for everything they’ve done for me.   Throughout my entire educational career I have worked to the best of my ability, in hopes of one day to be given a full ride scholarship to a great university. As the time to apply to college came closer and closer, I began to worry whether or not I would achieve my goal of not having to worry about paying for my education. Due to this, I began to search “full ride scholarship (name of university)” with hopes of coming across as scholarship I could apply to. The summer before my senior year, I visited Northeastern and fell in love with everything it had to offer, including co-op. When I searched “full ride Northeastern University,” the Torch Scholars program came up in the search results. I immediately became interested and searched through the Torch website. As I read the eligibility criteria, I noticed that I was associated with everything it said. The next day I immediately went to one of my teachers to ask her if she could nominate me for this life-changing scholarship.   When I first found out I was selected as a Torch Scholar, I was overwhelmed with joy and gratitude. I felt like God and the donors to this program had given me the biggest blessing ever. To me, becoming a Torch Scholar showed me that all the years of countless hours put into succeeding and going above and beyond had been worth it. I always knew I would go to college, but I always wondered how I would pay for my education. I did not want to just become another statistic. Growing up, all the professionals around me were everything but Hispanic. It made me feel as if my ethnicity was inferior. However, I came to realized that we just lack the resources needed to get on track for success. Torch gave me the necessary resources for me to achieve success. Now, because of Torch, neither my family nor I  have the burden of having to pay for my education, and to me that is amazing. I am beyond grateful for everything Torch has done and will continue to do for me.   Currently, I am in the beginning of my second semester at Northeastern. I am planning to pursue a degree in Behavioral Neuroscience while on a Pre-Medicine track. I know I will face more obstacles along the way, but I know that my Torch family will always be there to help. This coming fall semester, I am planning on studying abroad. I still do not know where I want to go though. Thanks to Torch, I can choose from a few schools in Australia or several schools throughout the United Kingdom. I would have never imagined that I would be able to do such a thing and not have to pay a single penny. Each and every day I wake up and realize that I am truly blessed to have this opportunity given to me, all thanks to donors like you.   I really would just like to express my gratitude. I could never thank you enough for all that you have done for this program. Thanks to you, and several others, this program helps students like me, who strive for success, to achieve their goals. It is truly heartwarming that there are people like you out there that truly care for helping others. I hope that one day, I too can help students like me in one way or another because essentially that is what I feel life should be about. If one is given a true blessing, one must pay it forward until it becomes an infinite cascade of paying it forward. Once again, thank you so much for everything you have done for me, and the other Torch Scholars. We are forever grateful!

You have changed my life and brought both my parents as well as my own dreams into reality.   I hope to someday be able to return the favor to you and your family as well as continue your legacy in supporting the program which gave me everything. ","I must begin this letter by stating how extremely grateful I am for everything you have done on my behalf.  Despite the fact that we have never met face to face, I still feel that you have played an enormous role in my life.  My name is Brett Shifflett, and I was fortunate enough to have been chosen to be part of the Torch family.  Born and raised in the small foothills of Virginia, I came from a school with a graduating class of merely one hundred and fifty students.  My parents attended the same high school as me, and unfortunately never had the chance to receive a college degree.  This, instead, was a dream that they held on to for me.  As the eldest of my siblings, my parents chose me as the example and always pushed me to the limit.  Unfortunately, when it came to college, even that was proving to not be enough.  Before Torch I was simply just another kid trying to pave his way through a small town in hopes of achieving large dreams – dreams that I had not seen as reality until Torch found me.Torch was a blessing in true form.  My guidance counselor, Angelina Santus, and I were always very close, and she was very much in support of me competing for a spot at Northeastern.  She was someone who believed I could achieve anything I set out to.  She believed this so much that she accompanied me on Torch interview day, marking the first day that either of us had ever flown on a plane.  People like Mrs. Santus and yourselves are the people who I look to for the drive I need to become the best scholar and individual I can possibly be.To be a Torch Scholar means so many things and is different for every scholar.  For me, it simply means that I am something more.  I am not just a Northeastern student, I am someone who has overcome obstacles that many of my peers have never experienced.  It means that I am someone who has proven their worth to others and have shown that I have what it takes to be great.  To me, being a Torch Scholar is not just a title, but a standard to which I am held – a standard that is pushing me to continually strive for excellence, for both myself and all of those who have chosen to support me along the way.  Currently I am the first Torch Scholar to pursue a degree in Architecture, accepting the challenge to pave the way for fellow scholars behind me in pursuit of such a degree.  I have learned so much more than I could have ever expected at Northeastern and I am grateful for that every day.  I have gone from a young man who had never flown, never seen the northern side of the United States, and never holding the intention to travel abroad; to someone who has experienced Brazilian culture first hand, intending to study architecture abroad in Berlin for nearly four months, as well as accepting the possibility of taking part in a co-op experience across the country.  All of these are things that never would have happened had it not been for Northeastern and the Torch program.  All of these are things that never would have happened without people like you.  Mr. and Mrs. Manganaro, thank you for taking a chance on me.  I wish I could explain my gratitude, but words simply cannot perform such justice.  You have changed my life and brought both my parents as well as my own dreams into reality.   I hope to someday be able to return the favor to you and your family as well as continue your legacy in supporting the program which gave me everything. ",,,,

I was born and raised in Stamford, CT by both of my parents. My family was born in Jamaica and moved to the country a few years before I was born. No one in my family had attended college so I am the first in my family to go. I’ve always been a good student and the importance of a college education was always something my mother instilled in my brain from a very young age. I’ve always wanted to go to college because I never wanted to struggle as much as they did in this country.  However, in 2011 my life had completely changed. My mother was diagnosed with stage four cancer and passed away after a two month battle. Shortly after, my father was diagnosed with dementia and moved to a nursing home. Today the disease has progressed and he no longer remembers who I am. It was hard going through high school without parents and without any family support. At that point in my life I was ready to give up on college because there was no way I could afford it and the whole idea seemed impossible.  In 2012, I decided to join this organization in downtown Stamford, Future 5. Future 5 is a nonprofit organization that helps low-income high school students get into college. Each student is connected with a mentor who aids them in the college application process. My mentor saw Northeastern and the Torch program online and encouraged me to apply. I applied and a few months later I would get the call saying I’ve been accepted. That day may have been the most exciting day of my life. For the first time after losing my parents, it looked like I may still have a bright future after all.  Today, I’m extremely proud to be a Torch scholar. To be a Torch Scholar means to me that there are people out there who have faith in me. There are people who believe that if I’m given the opportunity, I can become successful in the future. I feel really blessed to call myself a Torch scholar. It is a title I hold dearly to my heart.  I’m currently studying Communications and Media Screen Studies. I’ve always been a strong writer and a creative thinker. As a result, the television and entertainment industry has always been an interest to me.  I’ve recently concluded my first co-op. I worked for Broadway Video at the Rockefeller Center in New York City. Broadway video is the production company that produces the Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon, Saturday Night Live and the Late Night Show with Seth Meyers. I lived and worked in the city for 8 months and I can honestly say that was the best 8 months of my life.  Torch allowed me to see the world through a different lens. In the summer of 2014, I studied French Language and Culture in Lyon and Paris, France. That was the first time I’ve ever been on a plane and the first time I’ve ever been to another country.  Torch has also given me the opportunity to have some amazing volunteer experiences. In Boston, I volunteer at Community Servings. This organization prepares and delivers food to Boston residents who are terminally ill. While I was in New York, I volunteered for NYC’s food bank in West Harlem. I would work in the soup kitchen and help serve hundreds of meals a day to the clients.  In the future I hope to graduate and find a full time job with a movie or television company. I’m not exactly sure if I want to be a producer, writer, talent manger, or etc. There are so many different departments I can work in with this industry and thanks to Torch the sky is the limit.  Therefore, I want to take this time to express my deepest gratitude for all that you have done for me and the other Torch scholars. If it weren’t for amazing individuals like you, I would never have been able to follow my dreams. I don’t know where I would be without Torch and its support. You have really changed my life for the better and made my lifelong dream a reality. Thank you so much for your financial support. I will be sure to stay in touch with Torch after I graduate in 2018. Torch will always have a special place in my heart forever.  ",,,,

I would like to take a moment to thank you for your support of the Torch program. Growing up in the inner city of Boston, I would never have dreamed of graduating from an amazing institution such as Northeastern. As I take the time to reflect on my journey, I am more and more grateful for the Torch program. To me it is not only a scholarship but a community that enables me to thrive in every aspect of my life. It is a community that has not only provided me with academic support but helped me realized the importance of helping others. When confronted with difficult decisions or obstacles, I know I can especially always count on the mentorship and wisdom of Mr. Jackson, the academic advisor for Torch.  The extent to which the Torch program has influenced my education has gone beyond the classroom. The financial support of it allowed me to travel to Europe and Africa, which has enabled me to develop a more complex view of the world. It was the enriching conversations that I was having with the locals about their cultures and history that made these experiences unique. It was the aid I was able to provide to rural schools in South Africa that intensified my desire to help the less privileged.  As a first generation college student, nothing will bring more joy to me than to see the look on my parents’ faces when I receive my diploma in May. This kind of life changing event would have not been possible without the support of individuals like you. Again, I would like to thank you on behalf of my parents and my fellow classmates. I hope you continue to support the Torch program.   ",,,,

I am currently a senior at Northeastern University majoring in Civil Engineering with a focus in Environmental Engineering. Originally from Upstate New York, I chose Northeastern because of the university’s focus on applied education and international perspective. My Northeastern experience has not only given me the technical skills necessary to work as an engineer, I have learned about my role as a global citizen. The Civil and Environmental Engineering Department has given me numerous opportunities to expand my education beyond the classroom, and pursue my passion for international development work. I hope to one day continue working internationally, and help develop infrastructure that will ultimately promote economic development in third world countries.Northeastern University is unique in that it encourages students to pursue their passions, academic or otherwise. I became very involved in Northeastern’s student chapter of Engineers Without Borders during my freshman year. Over time, I took on more responsibility and went on to serve as the Vice President of Development and President of the entire chapter. I had the opportunity to travel with Engineers Without Borders to assist in the implementation of the community-wide water distribution system in Bbanda, Uganda. Northeastern is a globally-focused institution, and during my time as a student I have taken advantage of the numerous international opportunities offered. The fall of my third year, I studied abroad for a semester at the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia. My study abroad experience was life changing. I gained a new perspective on the world and learned about my role as a global citizen. The summer before my final year at Northeastern, I traveled to Iceland through a Dialogue for Civilizations Program to study geology and environmental science in a field setting. Cooperative education is another of the pillars of the Northeastern experience. I have completed three co-op assignments in the Greater Boston Area. For my first co-op, I worked for the environmental permitting department of Eversource. My second co-op was with Environmental Partners Group, a small environmental consulting company located in Quincy, MA. At Environmental Partners, I worked closely with the engineering team and had the opportunity to improve my technical skills. For my third and final co-op I worked at Hazen and Sawyer, where I worked on water and wastewater treatment infrastructure projects. I am incredibly grateful to be the recipient of the William S. and Diane Howard Scholarship. This award has helped alleviate my financial burden as I continue to pursue higher education. Once again, thank you for supporting the students of Northeastern University.",,,,

I have really enjoyed my first year here.  I have taken intellectually stimulating classes and met great people. Outside of the classroom I have been able to be a member of the alpine ski team.  The team has allowed me to meet people in other majors and continue a sport that has been very important to me my whole life. I am currently in the process of finding a position for my first co-op.  I look forward to expanding my knowledge outside of the classroom setting and being able to bring that knowledge back to the classroom again next spring.  I am still interesting in a broad variety of things and hope that through co-op I can find my strongest passions.  Having a full-time job will be a new experience for me, and I am very excited.

She often made bouquets of flowers for so many people, but she never met any of them. Even though they were strangers to her, she worked on each bouquet like she was receiving the bouquet herself.  She didn’t know it, but she could have been saving a relationship with the way she tied 2 yellow roses together or bringing a smile to a patient at Children’s Hospital with the way she assorted sunflowers with one single daisy.  She could have been an integral part in someone’s happiness and not even know it.  Malia flowers are people who have a special impact on the lives of others, sometimes knowingly and sometimes not. My name is Marione Besas – but my friends call me Ella.  I received a scholarship from the Women Who Inspire Scholarship Fund, and I would like to thank you both and let you know how much you both have touched my heart. Mr. and Mrs. Nasella, you two are Malia flowers.   I am a small town New Yorker in my fifth year as a Speech-Language Pathology Accelerated student at Northeastern University.  My story starts at Binghamton University – that is where I was going to go, along with the rest of my high school.  It was a small state school, significantly cheaper than Northeastern, and my tuition deposit was in.  However, I also visited Northeastern University and quickly fell in love – granted there were no snowstorms or howling winds to deter me from my immediate and withstanding emotions but regardless, Northeastern is where I truly wanted to go. They had the major I wanted, the accelerated program that would allow me to graduate in five years with my Bachelors and Masters degree, a dialogue to let me explore the world, and co-op and clinical experiences that would allow me to explore my future profession.  My mom and I knew that we could not afford the school but we agreed to apply for loans.  We got rejected but applied again and again and waited and waited for our desired response, but no response came quick enough.  My mom has four kids and, in my eyes, she is out of this world.  She works hard everyday, as parents do for their children, and makes sure she tries her very best to provide us with what she knows we want.  A few days before the deposit for Northeastern was due, she came into my room, at 3 a.m., crying.  She explained, behind her hard sobs and uncontrollable breathing, that she was a “bad parent” and that she was “sorry.” We stayed up until sunrise convincing each other that everything will be okay and that no matter where I end up, we would make the most out of it.  I have always been a hard-working student but it was in that moment that I knew that I wanted to work hard for my mom – to show her, not only how great but, how good she is.  To show her how blessed I am to call her mom.  We found out the next day that we were approved for loans and I would no longer be a Bearcat but could instead become a Husky.  If I was choosing to take out these loans, I would make the most of my experience at Northeastern University.  I have been on the E-board for the Speech-Language Pathology & Audiology Association (undergraduate and graduate), I am the Secretary at the Catholic Center, I sing in choir, I have volunteered through Circle K, I won the Northeastern University Student Speech-Language and Hearing Association Award, I have received the Bouve Service Award, I completed a co-op at Perkins School for the Blind, I went on a dialogue to Spain, I have completed three clinical experiences (at a university clinic, at a middle & high school, and a pediatric private clinic), I am currently working at a SNF in Beverly, I was a teacher’s assistant for international graduate engineering students, I worked in Bouve student services and talked to prospective SLPs, and I am a 5-foot woman that participated on a flag football and volleyball intramural team.  I run at least 25 miles a week and I love photography.  I am the nerd in my friend group and I am proud of it.  I try my best to appreciate the little things in life because they should not go unnoticed, and I believe in Malia flowers.  I am striving to become a Speech-Language Pathologist that works with those who have suffered through brain trauma, strokes, or have deterioration diseases/disorders.  My current clinical placement allows me to work with adults who have had TBIs, Alzheimer’s, Dementia, Dysphagia, and/or Cognitive disorders – and I love it.  My professor, Dr. Therese O’Neil, has been such an inspiration in my life.  She has confirmed my love for my future profession and I can only hope to be half the SLP that she is.  She has shared so much of her knowledge with my peers and me and I am still in awe by how much she knows and does. She is another one of my Malia flowers.   I would like to be someone else’s Malia flowers because I know how good receiving them feels and if something is so genuinely and purely good, why not share that with as many people as possible?  Something like that should not be contained.  Thank you both for being that good in my life and in spite of all this snow, thank you for bringing more Malia flowers to my life.   “I have this theory that if one person can go out of their way to show compassion, then it will start a chain reaction of the same. People will never know how far a little kindness can go.” – Rachel Joy Scott Although, your kindness is not little, it has brought so much joy to my life.    ",,,,

I would like to thank you for your support for the Women Who Empower Scholarship Fund. I chose to attend Northeastern University due to the co-op program that is offered. The program really helps with the process and I thought it would be a terrific way to get experience in finding and interviewing for jobs. Additionally, I find it helps to slowly adjust you to the real world instead of being clueless with no experience after graduation. Due to the assistance provided by the co-op program, I will be going on an engineering co-op from January to June at Boston Scientific. I want to use the knowledge that I gain in college to make a positive impact on the world. I plan to contribute to products that can influence people all around the world and not just on consumer products but on the production of devices that can affect a person’s life tremendously. I hope to pursue a career in the future that will allow me to use everything that I learn in college to good use and apply concepts and knowledge that I acquire to real life situations. When I heard about receiving this scholarship I was extremely ecstatic as it will lift a financial burden on my parents. This will allow me to focus more on my studies as I will not be as concerned about my financial situation. Additionally, my sister is going off to college next year and this scholarship will provide her with a wider range of opportunities because of the burden lifted from my parents. Again, I would like to restate how much I appreciate your support for the scholarship fund and let you know how thankful I am for your contributions.",,,,
001773554,Beckers,Emily Beckers,Individual,,,Bio TK,,Women Who Empower Scholarship Fund,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spain,,,,America’s Test Kitchen,,,,Thank you so much for all your contributions that have made this scholarship possible for me and the other students who receive it; it makes a huge difference to each and every one of us recipients. ,"My name is Emily Beckers, and I am a third-year student studying computer science and music technology at Northeastern University. I originally chose Northeastern because I was interested in majoring in computer science, and the fact that Northeastern had an entire college of computer and information science made it clear to me that they really cared about the students going through this program. This was confirmed to me when, during my freshman orientation, one of the associate deans recognized me from my high school college visit over a year prior. I knew then that I was definitely in the right place.  So far, I’ve had opportunities through Northeastern that I never would’ve had otherwise. Last semester, I studied abroad in Spain, and was there for five months taking classes in Spanish and learning about their culture. This semester, I am working as a tutor for the Fundamentals of Computer Science 1 course, and intend to become a TA next year. I’ve written musical compositions that were performed by live musicians, and I am doing another one of these this year as well. And this upcoming spring, I am going to be on my first co-op as a software engineer at America’s Test Kitchen. Receiving the Women Who Empower Scholarship has really helped me be able to continue learning and growing. My family has been through a lot in the past few years. My mother passed away in high school, and my father essentially had to stop working in order to be there for my sister and me. We were living off of the money we got from my mother’s life insurance for a few years, and at that time I was eligible for just about every single need-based loan and grant that was available. My father remarried last year, and his wife’s job was a very nice one, nice enough that I lost several of those need-based loans because I didn’t have the same level of need anymore. However, as the universe has a way of keeping things from getting too comfortable, she lost this job right after all the financial aid was decided.  Receiving this scholarship closed that gap for me, and it made it possible for me to really focus on my studies. It allowed me to take the part-time job that I really wanted, instead of forcing me to go looking for one that would pay better or give me more hours. It’s allowed me to put the money from that job towards the rent on the apartment that I share with my best friends, and towards taking care of the lovely little cat that we adopted together. Next year, I will have money saved up from my co-op to fall back on, but this year money is tight for my family and me, and having this scholarship really lifted a burden off of our shoulders and has allowed me to enjoy doing the things that I really love to be doing. Thank you so much for all your contributions that have made this scholarship possible for me and the other students who receive it; it makes a huge difference to each and every one of us recipients.

Your financial assistance has significantly helped me to reach this point, and I am immensely thankful and appreciative.  Thank you once again for so generously contributing to my education. ","Thank you for being so generous in contributing to my education this year.  I am so appreciative to be a recipient of the Women Who Empower Scholarship, and I truly view it as an honor.  I haven’t been to any Women Who Empower events yet, but I hope to be able to attend more events once I return to classes from co-op in January. Currently, I am in my fourth year of pharmacy school, and I am on co-op at the Eaton Apothecary inside the Brockton Neighborhood Health Center in Brockton, MA.  This co-op is fulfilling my community pharmacy co-op requirement. This pharmacy is an outpatient setting, so it is different from the typical community setting, but I am enjoying it and I am learning a lot. Last year I did a co-op at South Shore Hospital doing medication reconciliation. I definitely learned a lot at this co-op, and the pharmacists that I worked with were always willing to teach me something beyond what was required of the co-op. Although I really liked working there, I don’t think that working specifically with medication reconciliation is something that I would want to do as a pharmacist. I am thinking of possibly pursuing a path in the pharmaceutical industry because of my interests with rare diseases. Looking back, I would probably say that I should have tried to pursue a co-op at a pharmaceutical company, but I think that a good thing about co-op is ruling out paths as well. Before I did the co-op at South Shore Hospital, I was really interested in doing medication reconciliation, so if I didn’t do this co-op I wouldn’t have realized that it wasn’t a perfect fit.  During my sixth, and final, year of school, I will do six rotations in different areas of pharmacy, so this will give me a good opportunity to work in a variety of fields to really solidify which path I would like to take after graduation. I took classes full-time this summer, and I enjoyed my classes and received all A’s. I took a pharmacy communications course, the second parts of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, and Healthcare Systems. Healthcare Systems was a very interesting course because we learned about a variety of topics including healthcare marketing, the state of the American healthcare system versus other countries, and the changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act. Since healthcare is a complicated topic today, I appreciated learning from this class. My two favorite topics within Pharmacology were toxicology and pharmacogenomics.  Pharmacogenomics was very interesting to me because I hadn’t specifically heard of it before, but I learned that this is a greatly emerging field. It was very interesting to learn all about how specific genes are related to how patients tolerate and react to medications, and it really seems like innovations in this field will greatly influence the future of pharmacy.  After I finish my co-op at the end of December, I will go to class for four semesters and then I will have my sixth year rotations. It is hard to believe that I am over half way done with the pharmacy program. Although I still have a lot of hard work ahead, I feel very fortunate to have come this far. Your financial assistance has significantly helped me to reach this point, and I am immensely thankful and appreciative.  Thank you once again for so generously contributing to my education. ",,,,

For many years I have referred to a quote by Franklin Delano Roosevelt which you epitomize. He once said “We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.” Your significant investment in first generation college students that is now approaching a decade, has allowed nearly 100 students to benefit from a top-_tier education at Northeastern University.Back in March of 2010, when I received the phone call informing me that I had been selected as a Torch Scholar, my life changed forever. As a native of an inner_city neighborhood in Staten Island, New York, I never fathomed that I could attend Northeastern, better yet on a full scholarship. I vowed to myself that I would take advantage of the opportunities afforded to me and somehow pay it forward to other students and youth.As an International Affairs & Political Science Major, I have had the opportunity to travel abroad to Geneva, Switzerland and Belo Horizonte, Brazil through the Dialogue of Civilization Program. I have completed three co_op experiences in the legal and non-profit sectors. This past semester I received the Undergraduate Research Initiative Award through which I will be working with Professor Miles of the Political Science Department on the Hausa Diaspora. I have also joined campus organizations, most notably Kappa Alpha Psi, where I currently sit on the Grand Board of Directors. I have been able to take advantage of the many academic and extracurricular opportunities at Northeastern.In my attempts to pay it forward, I have committed to mentoring high school students in the Greater Boston area through the Kappa League Leadership Development Institute. Kappa League is a national model which we adapted locally by recruiting students in area schools and developed a curriculum to enrich their lives.As I look to graduate in a few short weeks, I am grateful for the friends and academic and social development that I have gained over the past five years. Through benefactors like you, I have built a solid foundation for my future. After graduation, I plan to enter the workforce for a year or two before applying and enrolling in law school. I hope to one day be in a position to change and affect public policy.Once again, thank you for your commitment to Northeastern University.

In order to give you a better understanding of how much your financial contribution means to me, I think that I should let you know more about myself in order to show the impact that this scholarship is having and will have on my life. I am a Sophomore Health Science Major from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and I was raised in the working class neighborhood of West Philadelphia. My mother is a music teacher and my father is a longshoreman, and even though they did not achieve as much as they would have liked to academically, they placed a high importance on education and instilled in me and my siblings the values of being hard working and being the best that we could be.  I carried these values with me through high school, and graduated Magna Cum Laude from the Philadelphia High School for Girls as a 4 year scholarship recipient, an International Baccalaureate candidate, and a National Honor Society Member. I, like most high school seniors, was left with the important decision of choosing which college to go to. My dream since freshman year of high school was to go to Boston and to get an amazing education and real world work experience from Northeastern University. However, coming from a working class background with no college savings or resources, this dream seemed like an unreachable fantasy. When I was accepted into Northeastern and three other colleges, I told myself to make the smart decision and to go with whichever school gave me the most financial aid and left me with the least amount of money to pay back.  I was ecstatic to see that Northeastern was the best financial choice for me. So here I am, in my sophomore year, steadily moving towards my goal of becoming a healthcare administrator and contributing to the healthcare field in the way that calls me the most, by working on the business side of healthcare in order to keep the hospitals running. Because of the information I have learned in my American Healthcare course, taught by the wonderful Professor Pauline Hamel, I have started to get a strong sense of where I see my impact on the world going. The impact of making the world a better place through healthcare administration is a dream that would have never been realized if it weren’t for the contributions of the Women Who Inspire Scholarship Fund. Your financial award is the reason why I am allowed to achieve my dreams, and for that I am eternally grateful.  ",,,,

If it wasn’t for this amazing scholarship, I’m not sure where I would have ended up. My story about applying is actually pretty coincidental. My high school senior class had taken a field trip to Boston and took a tour of Northeastern. At some point during the day, the director at the time presented about Torch. I wasn’t able to attend the trip but when my guidance counselor came back she told me to add Northeastern my college list. She didn’t give much of an explanation but said that she could picture me going there and they had a really good scholarship. After receiving a letter saying I made the top 50, I looked into what exactly Torch entailed. I had no idea at the time how amazing the Torch program was and the community of students it brought together. I’m a mechanical engineering major still searching for my focus within the field. These past four years at Northeastern have been beyond life changing for both my family and me. The co-op program here has allowed me to experience opportunities right at my door. Being from Hartford, Connecticut, I had no idea about the existence of Sikorsky Aircraft, only 45 minutes south of my house. I spent my first co-op working closely with the engineering team there which builds naval helicopters. Being a Torch Scholar means everything to me. If it wasn’t for this opportunity, I’m not sure if I could have afforded to attend even Community College, let alone had the support to pursue such an intense degree. I’ve grown so much over the past four years and met so many amazing scholars. Those specifically in Torch have become my greatest friends. Having an amazing support group of other scholars who are going through the same or similar struggles as me has made my time here a lot easier. I’m not exactly sure of what I’d like to do with my degree when I graduate in May 2016, but I still have time to decide.

I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to attend Northeastern University, through your continued support of the Torch Program. I just want to give you a brief description of my background, and show you how much Torch means to me. I was born in Newark, NJ were I spent most of my life, until I moved to Greensboro, NC with my mom during my sophomore year of high school. When applying to college and researching scholarship programs, I came across the Torch Program and immediately asked my college counselor to recommend me for the scholarship. In March of 2012 I was awarded the opportunity to become a Torch 7 Scholar and things have only looked up since. I am currently a fourth-year Business Administration and Economics dual major with a concentration in Finance and two minors in International Affairs and Social Entrepreneurship. I did my first co-op with Putnam Investments on the Performance and Analytics team, and now I am at State Street working with State Street Global Advisors on the Global Funds Management team. Without Torch I don’t know if I would have been able to be in the position that I am now, and setting myself up for future success. Because of the Torch program I was able to travel out of the country for the first time through the dialogue program. For my first dialogue I went to Bali, Indonesia, and worked with Ganesha University to present ideas on potential success Social Enterprises. For my second dialogue I studied the economic development of Morocco post-colonization and got the chance to travel to France and Morocco. Being a part of the CEP program I was fortunate enough to give back to the local community through Lead. Lead is a program that places college students with a senior from a local High School to mentor them and help them apply to college. Now, I am currently a mentor for the Dream Program which helps underprivileged youth in the Madison Park Area. Upon graduation I plan to move back to Charlotte, NC and work for Wells Fargo or Bank of America doing Investment Management. As my time at Northeastern continues to dwindle away I can proudly say that Torch has helped shape me into a better student and person. I can only hope that I continue down this path of growth so that one day I will be able to give back to my community like you have so generously done.

There she grew to understand that rejection in a host country is a common migrant experience throughout the world. Having spent a number of years working on behalf of immigrants within the US, Mary took an internship with a nonprofit focused on regional migration rights in Southeast Asia. She spent five months traveling throughout the region, learning its history and culture and gained a better understanding of the different roles research, advocacy and legal representation play in social justice work. Mary believes a legal education will enable her to build upon her skills and harness the power of the law to create more equitable access to justice for all.",,Public Interest Law,,,,,,,9/18/87,,,,0,United States,WI,54227,0,0,0,,,,,,,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

001732151,Clavijo,Paula Andrea Restrepo Clavijo,Individual,,,Bio TK,,Torch Scholars Program,,,,,,,1/9/96,,,,1,United States,FL,33024,0,0,0,,,,,,,,Female,,,,,,,,,,Because of this scholarship I am able to go to a top university that will prepare me for the future and hopefully one day prepare me to make an impact on the world. ,"I wanted to share with you know how much I sincerely appreciate the support I have received from the Albert W. Tenney, Jr. Torch Scholarship Fund. Because of this scholarship I am able to go to a top university that will prepare me for the future and hopefully one day prepare me to make an impact on the world. This is my first year in college, and I could not be any happier than to be here and work hard for my education.  I was born in Bogota, Colombia, and immigrated to The United States in 2001 on Thanksgiving. My permanent home is in South Florida. I have been fortunate enough to have parents that always advocated for my education, thus the reason they made a sacrifice leaving everything behind to come to this country. However, when I was in middle school my mother had a stroke and became very sick, and my father became unemployed. This caused for me to have to take the responsibility of taking care of my mother and the household while still marinating my grades at school, while my father looked for a stable job. When I entered high school, he found a job that he held for four years, but on December 31, 2013, my dad was laid off again because the company was closing. For me, this was the worst moment possible because it was prime time for me to apply for colleges. I received several acceptances, but I was offered little to no financial aid. The situation was not the best at home, to the point that I was even considering just getting a job after graduation because there was no way I could afford my education. On March 28th I received a call that altered my course all together, notifying me that I had been granted the Torch scholarship. At first I was shell shocked.  I just could not believe it. I remember that morning I woke up a bit depressed thinking that I was not going to be able to go to college and have to put my dreams on hold. Torch reestablished that hope in me.  I am so grateful to Mr. Tenney for his role in that. ","My intended major at this moment is Chemical Engineering, and you may ask yourself what I intend to do with that. What I desire to do with my major is work in genetic engineering. My mother is my inspiration, because she was diagnosed with a genetic disease that has impaired her and not allowed her to live life to the fullest.  She depends on medicine and the support of other people. I desire to work in research, where hopefully one day I would be able to help find a cure for a genetic disease and make someone’s life easier.  As of now, since I am still in my first year, I do not have any co-op experience. However, this summer I am going to be able to travel to Tarragona and Barcelona, Spain, on a Dialogue of Civilizations study travel trip for Chemical Engineers. I am extremely excited because it is one of my dreams to travel to Europe. If you would have asked me a year ago what I thought I would be doing today, I would have probably just said I would be living at home and working a full time-job to save up for college. This scholarship is a true blessing in my life, and I plan to take advantage of it to the fullest.  Just as John F. Kennedy stated, “As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.”  ",,,

You have changed my life, and I thank you for that. My name is Djibril Diabate, and I am from the Bronx, New York. I grew up in a neighborhood in the Bronx called Fulton. I went to Cristo Rey New York High School, which is a small private/public school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It’s the kind of school that is innovative in its approach to teaching by allowing students to work one day a week at a corporate business such as JP Morgan Chase, White and Case, and other renowned business in New York. I myself worked at Keefe Bruyette & Woods and Sullivan and Cromwell, where I was exposed to so much of the corporate world that I feel like I am ready for whatever challenges there are in the work force. It was actually through a college trip with my school that I learned about Torch. During my junior year, the school began this initiative where they sought to expose us the college culture early. They took us on a college trip around the New England area, and luckily one of the destinations was Northeastern. It was through the information session with Shannon Pittman and Leroy Jackson that I was able to understand what Northeastern had to offer to me and how I could be apart of a family of people destined to change the world. Now that I am a part of this family, I feel like I am doing myself an injustice if I don’t change the world in which we live. By adding the title Torch Scholar to my name, I feel like I now have people backing me up and wanting me to succeed while changing the world. Currently I am on the path of becoming a Computer Science and Business Major with a concentration in Marketing. I felt the need to join a field in which I find enjoyment and that has many opportunities for growth, and computer science is that field. By adding business, it will help make me a well-rounded person and eventually reach an end goal in which I can start a business that can change the world we live in. I plan on making moves to change this world in little but powerful steps. One of those steps I am taking towards making the world a better place is by volunteering at Roxbury Multi-Service Center. I work with kids between the ages of 8-13. I assist them with practically anything they need help on from homework to what color to choose to color in a book. It is something I find enjoyment in and something that I think everyone should invest some time of their day into doing. It helps make our world a better place because I can be a role model to these kids and show them how to also change the world one step at a time. In the future, I want to open a company that works as a consultant for schools and academic-related programs to help them make their programs top notch and more efficient. It is something that I see as an end goal for me, because I know it is going to take me years to accomplish, but I am ready for that. I want to change the way the youth in our society function because someone did that for me! Someone believed in me and invested in me! That someone is you, and I thank you for that! Now it is only right that I do the same for others! Once again, thank you. If you’re ever having a bad day, remember that you helped change my life and the lives of many other people, and you’re wonderful people.",,,,

001776809,Snow,Christian Snow,Individual,,,"Christian graduated from Grinnell College in 2013 with a BA in sociology and history. Growing up in an impoverished, predominantly minority community, Christian quickly became used to the overwhelming presence of the “law”, but never comfortable with it. Christian’s undergraduate studies opened her eyes to the inner workings and construction of the system of oppression that keeps minority communities at a disadvantage. She began to look for ways to alter the system as it played out in her college environment, mentoring other students and establishing identity communities on campus. After graduation, Christian spent a year working as a new sector resident in social enterprise with Street-Level Youth Media, a facility and free media arts education program that provides Chicago’s under-resourced youth with a much-needed outlet for positive self-expression and cultural production. She then spent six months with Street Level as a community engagement manager, before volunteering for six months with a west-side church. Christian’s belief in knowledge as empowerment was the driving force behind her desire to study law.

Gryzmish Law Student Fund. As the first person in my family to pursue a legal career, my family and I were not prepared for the financial burden that law school would impose. With that said, my family, who continuously support and encourage me throughout this journey, and I greatly appreciate your financial contribution. With only six months left before graduation, I have spent a great deal of time lately reflecting about my time at Northeastern as well as my future career. Originally from Florida, I chose to stay in state for my undergraduate degree and attended the University of Florida. The decision to leave my home state and relocate to Boston for law school was a tough decision, but I was drawn to Northeastern. I admired the school’s commitment to public interest and felt it would give me a unique perspective on the legal work that would be beneficial in my future endeavors. Even more, the co-op program seemed like the perfect opportunity to explore different areas of law and determine what the best fit was for me. Through the co-op program, I have had a myriad of experiences, including both state and federal government and the private sectors. My ultimate goal is to work with start-up companies and help to promote minority-owned businesses, with a hope of diversifying the business world. With the end near, I am thoroughly pleased with my decision to attend Northeastern. My law school experience would not have been as rewarding if I had gone anywhere else. I have learned so much from the faculty and the other students and have grown as a person. Also, the Northeastern community of alumni and friends, such as yourself, have proven to be beyond supportive in multiple ways. Again, thank you for this gracious gift.

ORG18,BlackEngineeringStudentSociety,Black Engineering Student Society,Non_Individual,,,"In the winter of 1974, Harold C. Hunte ‘76 and Harold Blake, two African American engineering students, sat in the African American Institute and reflected on how few African American engineers they knew. During the early 1970s, African American enrollment in the College of Engineering was low compared to Northeastern’s other colleges. Hunte and Blake felt that African American engineering students had little interaction with one another because they were spread throughout the college’s six disciplines.In an effort to unite them, letters about the formation of an engineering organization were sent to all African American engineers. On April 18, 1974, Hunte and Blake founded the Black Engineering Student Society (BESS). The organization’s mission was to form a network for and solidarity among student engineers, building a support system for engineers to ensure that they would stay in the field. Ray Guthrie, Assistant to the Dean of the College of Engineering, became the group’s advisor.In hopes of increasing the number of African American engineers at Northeastern, one of BESS’s projects was to interest high school students in engineering as a profession. BESS members visited local English High School and coached juniors and seniors on the process of applying to Northeastern’s College of Engineering.In April of 1975, BESS merged to be one of the chartered chapters of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)",http://nuweb2.neu.edu/bess/wp-content/themes/BESS/bootstrap/img/bess_logo.PNG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to prepare for the exam, chapter members coordinated with civil engineering professors who were willing to donate their time and instruct evening review sessions in exam topics such as fluid mechanics, structural analysis, and transportation engineering. Chi Epsilon provided pizza at the sessions. We plan to continue them next year, as the participating students found the review sessions to be both helpful and accommodating. CANstruction is a yearly design build contest where groups create structures using cans to follow a specific theme. After the contest, the cans are donated to the Merrimack Valley Food Bank (MVFB). This past year’s theme, “Boston - 20 Years,” marked the 20th anniversary of the event. Students from our chapter teamed up with Wiss, Janney and Elstner Associates, Inc. (WJE) to come up with a creative structure. The final design, entitled “Boston - CanSTRONGtion,” consisted of a Boston Strong ribbon, a symbol of Boston’s resilience in the face of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. It was built using 1,416 nonperishable food cans. Cans were purchased with support from the Scranton Fund and WJE. The CANstruction contest is rewarding in many ways. The creativity and intellect required to come up with a unique design is equally as rewarding as the philanthropic aspect of the event. CANstruction exposed us to real world situations that tested and improved our abilities. According to CANstruction, in 2015, the competition donated 24,000 pounds of food for families in need.",http://os_extranet_images.s3.amazonaws.com/315764_original.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

College of Science students also pursue research positions in Boston and around the world- with hospitals, businesses, and private and government research institutions-through Northeastern’s signature co-op program, or through an academic internship.Our students take advantage of opportunities to explore the larger possibilities of science and mathematics, and view their major field of study from new perspectives, by engaging in community service and global learning activities in such rich locales for learning as the Galapagos Islands and Panama.Our college promotes interdisciplinary research and interdisciplinary thinking among faculty and students, fostering the pursuit of innovation-driven discoveries that make an impact on lives. And because interdisciplinary programs at Northeastern often cut across broad areas of study-the arts, humanities, engineering, social sciences, and computer science-these connections extend beyond the confines of mathematics and science.By combining the outstanding academics, real-world experience, and interdisciplinary opportunities of a world-class research university, the College of Science provides students with the best foundation to achieve their goals, in graduate school and in the professional world.",http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/copy-cropped-cos-large.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ORG28,DMSB,D'Amore-McKim School of Business,Non_Individual,,,"North_eastern alumni Richard D’Amore and Alan McKim invested a com_bined $60 mil_lion in the university’s school of busi_ness last fall, placing them among the nation’s 50 most gen_erous donors to non_profit orga_ni_za_tions in 2012.D’Amore is a co-__founder and gen_eral partner at North Bridge Ven_ture Part_ners, a ven_ture cap_ital firm based in Waltham, Mass. McKim is the founder and CEO of Clean Har_bors, the nation’s leading provider of envi_ron_mental, energy and indus_trial services.Their com_bined gift rep_re_sents the largest phil_an_thropic invest_ment in Northeastern’s his_tory. As a result of their gen_erous con_tri_bu_tion, the university’s Col_lege of Busi_ness Admin_is_tra_tion was offi_cially named the D’Amore-McKim School of Busi_ness.“A gift is about a pas_sion and a part_ner_ship to make a dream come true and to leave a legacy,” said Joseph E. Aoun, pres_i_dent of North_eastern. “Rich and Alan’s unprece_dented invest_ment in their alma mater will advance North_eastern to new heights and will keep their legacy alive forever.”Both D’Amore and McKim grew up in the Boston area and enrolled in Northeastern’s Col_lege of Busi_ness Admin_is_tra_tion as under_grad_u_ates. Although both dropped out, they were each drawn back to the col_lege that would later become their alma mater and, ulti_mately, bear their names. D’Amore received an under_grad_uate busi_ness degree and McKim a master’s in busi_ness administration.Over the past five years, D’Amore and McKim have become actively engaged with the uni_ver_sity as mem_bers of the Board of Trustees. Their prior gifts focused on inno_va_tion and entre_pre_neur_ship, core values that span col_leges and dis_ci_plines at Northeastern.“Rich D’Amore and Alan McKim are won_derful rep_re_sen_ta_tives of the lasting bonds cre_ated between North_eastern and the stu_dents who come here,” said Diane MacGillivray, senior vice pres_i_dent for uni_ver_sity advance_ment. “I am not sur_prised that two of the top 50 phil_an_thropists in the nation are North_eastern alumni. Nor am I sur_prised that North_eastern inspired them to make such gen_erous and heart_felt gifts. It speaks directly to the kind of insti_tu_tion we are and the incred_ible com_mu_nity of alumni who remain com_mitted to our success.”In a cel_e_bra_tion of the naming of the school of busi_ness last October, they both expressed their appre_ci_a_tion for the role North_eastern has played in their suc_cess. D’Amore char_ac_ter_ized his invest_ment as a vote of con_fi_dence in Northeastern’s stu_dents, fac_ulty, and senior leaders, all of whom, he said, have remained true to the university’s long_standing “prac_tical, prag_matic and real-__world orientation.”In his remarks, McKim noted that studying at North_eastern has “helped shaped who I am as a pro_fes_sional but more impor_tantly as an individual.”He also chal_lenged young researchers and entre_pre_neurs to make a world_wide dif_fer_ence through class, co-__op, and extra-__curricular oppor_tu_ni_ties. “I know this gift will shape tomorrow’s busi_ness leaders and entre_pre_neurs who will create inno_va_tions that will improve our lives,” he said. “I hope stu_dents will take advan_tage of what this unique cul_ture has to offer.”",https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_674_240/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAKHAAAAJDc2N2U2ODhkLTQwNGMtNDM3ZC1iODgzLWFkMjg1NTA1ZTBmNg.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Saskatchewan native had successful turns with the Boston Bruins, as well as the Toronto Maple Leafs, with whom he clinched the 1951 Stanley Cup.Now, a group of alumni is honoring his legacy as the longest-serving men’s ice hockey coach in Northeastern’s history.In 1970, Flaman took the helm of Northeastern’s team. In the course of 19 seasons, he led the Huskies to four Beanpot tournament championships, an NCAA Frozen Four championship appearance, and a coveted Hockey East championship title in 1988.Jim Madigan, DMSB’86, the current men’s ice hockey coach and a three-time Beanpot winner, vividly recalls those championship runs. Playing for Flaman showed Madigan just how difficult—and exhilarating—it is to excel in Hockey East. “Fernie took a decent but somewhat sleepy program to the top of the toughest, most competitive collegiate hockey division in the country,” Madigan says.Today, Madigan is delighted that a group of six alumni has sought to honor his predecessor’s legacy by establishing the Fernie Flaman Endowed Head Hockey Coach position. A $1 million gift from William Shea, LA’70, MA’72, jump-started the initiative in the fall of 2014 and inspired another $600,000 in gifts. Athletics Director Peter Roby is looking to other alumni to honor both Madigan and Flaman and meet a total goal of $2 million.“These funds will elevate the entire player experience,” says Roby, by supporting needs from equipment upgrades, nutritional support, and improved training, to injury prevention and recovery.Jim Madigan, DMSB’86, and current hockey coach played for Fernie Flaman, and calls him a model worth emulating.Jim Madigan, DMSB’86, and current hockey coach played for Fernie Flaman, and calls him a model worth emulating.An endowment for coaching will also elevate the university’s profile, Roby says. “The Fernie Flaman Endowed Head Hockey Coach sends a clear message that our alumni are fully invested in our program.” This will be the first endowed coaching position in Northeastern’s history, and only the second in Hockey East.In much the same way that endowed chairs honor university professors, endowed positions in athletics honor coaches, who also play vital roles in shaping students’ lives. “Fernie’s leadership established a tradition of hard work, good character, and athletic accomplishment,” Madigan says. “A strong hockey program provides yet another avenue for our students to achieve excellence.”In the pressure-packed arena of Hockey East, Northeastern will gain a competitive edge. “This endowed position not only honors a Northeastern hockey legend,” Roby says, “but also gives our players and coaching staff essential tools to keep them at the top of the conference.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
